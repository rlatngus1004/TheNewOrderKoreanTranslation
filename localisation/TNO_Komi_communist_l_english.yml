 NIK_pcoup_ponomaryovs_coup_desc:0 "The Syktvykar Left, and the Komi Communist Party, have long since decried the Republic for being a bourgeois-democratic institution - a state that spat on the grave of the old Union, and brought rise to capitalism and decadence in Syktyvkar.\n\nHowever, the days of this have come to an end, with the seizure of power by the Communist Party, headed by General Secretary Boris Ponomaryov. Already, the previous National Assembly has been arrested and imprisoned, with only those determined to be loyal allowed to take their seats. The era of bourgeois democracy is over in Syktyvkar, it seems - at least, if Ponomaryov and his shadowy backers have anything to say about it."
 NIK_pcoup_appeal_for_a_united_party_desc:0 "The Left, in general, has accumulated a reputation for internal factionalism and bickering within its institutions. However, this is not the time for infighting. To consolidate the influence of the Revolution in Komi, we must cast aside the particularities of our ideological interpretations for now, and focus on effective and constructive governance.\n\nThe General Secretary, with backing from Premier Suslov, will pass a decree immediately, banning factionalism and suspending political activity outside sanctioned events, until the duration of our current crisis is over."
 NIK_pcoup_find_zhdanovs_connections_desc:0 "Andrei Zhdanov. The 'official' leader of the Communist Party in Komi, who has been temporarily sidelined with Suslov's endorsement of Ponomaryov for provisional General Secretary status. The man is considered by many within the Party to be... eccentric, but he is nothing if not skilled and well-connected.\n\nIn order to secure our rule, we must consult Zhdanov in order to link up with his more 'unconventional' allies, and work together to save our new Republic."
 NIK_pcoup_repurpose_the_systems_desc:0 "Now is not the time for idealism. The bureaucracy of the old Republic was crucial for keeping its basic functions online - the essential organs of the state continue to exist under our management, maintaining a sort of bitter standoff with the new ruling party. To ensure that we are capable of governing at all, during and even after the Revolution, addressing the remaining government bureaucrats and reassuring them of our benevolent intentions is a course of action we must follow."
 NIK_pcoup_on_suslovs_orders_desc:0 "While Ponomaryov may be the General Secretary of the Party, and thus the head of state of the Republic, we must remember that a single man does not a socialist system make. Mikhail Suslov, Chief Ideologue of the Communist Party and Premier of the Republic, can be trusted to maintain the essential democratic functions of the Communist Party. Empowering the Premiership to make decisions regarding appointments to high positions, as well as several other functions that were formerly only granted to the President of the Republic, will ensure that the head of the new socialist republic never becomes a dictator."
 NIK_pcoup_lock_down_syktyvkar_desc:0 "The Revolution against the previous government caught many by surprise, and cast Syktyvkar into a state of absolute chaos, as well as destabilizing other urban centers throughout the Republic. While the capital itself is solidly under our control, we must recognize that the outlying rural areas could very well be hosting remnant Republican Army units, and reactionary partisans. Thusly, the Presidium of the Komi Soviet Republic shall pass a decree limiting travel in and out of Syktyvkar, until the current crisis has elapsed."
 NIK_pcoup_mobilize_suslovs_men_desc:0 "Whilst certain socialist heroes and patriots within the old Republican Army have collaborated with our new government, and furnished us with weapons, armored vehicles, and manpower, this is not the entirety of the resources that we are capable of mobilizing. Before the Revolution, Premier Suslov oversaw the creation of numerous socialist paramilitary units and partisans, tasked with working alongside the Party to secure true proletarian rule over the Republic. Now that our control has been established, we can officially commission this reserve into a reorganized Komi Red Army, and establish a truly reliable armed forces."
 NIK_pcoup_hunt_down_Taboritsky_desc:0 "Ivan Serov. The accursed traitor to the Party, that nearly sabotaged our efforts once before. The man that very nearly could make one believe in the myth of "red fascism".\n\nBy the unanimous decree of the Party, Serov is to be brought to justice, effective immediately. In a way, he is to be an example to all of the Republic - an example of the fate that we will bring upon fascists and terrorists. The old Republic was utterly unwilling to resist the forces of reaction, but we will never repeat that mistake."
 NIK_pcoup_paralyze_the_army_desc:0 "The Komi Republican Army, with the exception of the units and officers that sided with us, is something that one could truly call an inherently reactionary organization. With our establishment of a parallel Red Army to replace the Komi Republican Army, the time has come to officially dissolve the reactionary institutions of the previous armed forces. Generals will be imprisoned, fascist infiltrators will be smoked out, and equipment will be repurposed for more constructive causes. The effect on our army shall be significant, but it shall be temporary, and it shall be worth it."
 NIK_pcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_communist_party_desc:0 "The Revolution has succeeded! From every building in Syktyvkar, the red flag waves, and in our other cities, proud parades march down main boulevards that were until a mere month ago, dens of the bourgeois. The old Republic has finally come to an end - the capitalist transitionary phase has been snuffed out by the proletarian revolution, and our new socialist republic has been birthed from its ashes.\n\nThe time is nigh for the end of our inward focus, and the beginning of our rightful reclamation of the Soviet Union. The Russian people, and soon the peoples of the world, shall welcome us as liberators!"

 NIK_zcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_people:0 "공화국은 인민의 것이다!"
 
 NIK_zcoup_zhdanovs_coup_desc:0 "마침내 부르주아 공화국의 막이 내렸습니다! 전선의 몰락 이후 코미 공화국의 인민들은 사회주의의 귀환과 인도를 꿈꿔왔고, 그 열망은 마침내 이루어졌습니다. 즈다노프 총서기장은 공화국의 지도자로서 통치에 나섰으며, 그의 동맹은 행정부와 국회를 손에 넣었습니다. 이에 인민들은 공산당의 귀환에 무척 기뻐하고 있습니다! \n\n그러나, 아직은 안심할 때가 아닙니다. 자유주의자, 사회-파시스트들, 구 정부라는 이름의 반동 즉 인민의 적들이 그늘진 곳에서 세를 키우며 마침내 자유를 맞은 인민의 정부를 전복시키려 합니다. 그러니 우리는 당의 위대한 선각자인 즈다노프 동지의 지도로, 반동분자들에 맞서 승리를 거머쥐고, 공화국을 새로운 시대로 인도하게 될 것입니다!"
 NIK_zcoup_the_peoples_alternative_desc:0 "Let the people of Komi realize - from the capitol building to the common citizen, that Andrei Zhdanov is what the people have craved for so long. He is a man of passion, who has a strong head on his shoulders, and his affable personality and relatable characteristics make him down-to-earth when compared to the stoic Suslov.\n\nThe government of Komi has failed to provide the people with the voice necessary to show their support for Zhdanov, so in his wisdom, he has chosen to force the gates open and let the citizens express their gratitude, and he he will make this fact well known to anyone who is willing to listen!"
 NIK_zcoup_connections_in_the_remnants_desc:0 "The DSNP has crashed and burned, and what remains are only the scant few politicians of Voznesensky that have no allies, nor any real support remaining. We will offer them a helping hand. They make not be filled with as much revolutionary zeal as us, but their ideology is a humane one, and, after all...\n\nWho would Zhdanov be, if he didn't respect the wishes of his friend?"
 NIK_zcoup_strike_against_tyranny_desc:0 "The monarchists and the social-fascists are content to sit and sap the strength of Komi away. Pathetic! What would we be if we did not eliminate the trace remnants of these reactionary ideologies? Some in Zhdanov's government, however, have voiced protests. If we strike too soon, we may run the risk of our efforts backfiring on us.\n\nZhdanov himself is content with burning out the fascist ilk like weeds on a garden, but nevertheless, he must listen - and only then will he determine the fate of the opposition."
 NIK_zcoup_promise_true_freedom_desc:0 "Freedom cannot be found in bourgeoisie democracy; there, you are chained by those whose wealth funnels to the top, that decide a man's future not fully of his own free will. Freedom cannot be found in fascism; there, you are tied to the identity of the state, a monolithic, faceless entity that only wishes to subsume the identity of those who fall prey to its inhuman tactics.\n\nOnly in Zhdanov's socialism may freedom be found! To vote, to think, to speak, to walk freely, to step forward and shatter the notion that this is the end of history!"
 NIK_zcoup_peoples_political_struggle_desc:0 "It would be silly to think that only those in the high castle can make decisions. Who are we to say that we must shut ourselves off and decide what the people want? Zhdanov's Komi is not a palace of nobles! We must encourage the citizens that it is their word that decides the future of this country.\n\nThose more politically-engaged will be encouraged to join local organizations dedicated to debating the ideas of socialism, while others will be recruited into government offices - the old, the young, the men and the women, all will lead Komi forward!"
 NIK_zcoup_freeze_the_activities_desc:0 "The capitalists and fascists will forever hide in the shadows, waiting for their opportunity to strike and ruin our efforts to advance humanity forward. That is why Zhdanov has proposed an idea - we will take measures, both legal and perhaps not so legal, to slow down the efforts of the opposing parties.\n\nIn his wisdom, Zhdanov will force them to pace their steps in such a way that anything they do will simply be countered with ease. None may bring down humanity, so long as they bear the torch of socialism!"
 NIK_zcoup_seed_the_files_desc:0 "Many things can be said about the capitalists - but the more radical of Zhdanov's government, including Zhdanov himself, see the democratic center as nothing more than a tool to eventually bring in the fascist menace. Much of Komi's population would not agree with this idea, however.\n\nWe have decided to take a course of action that would be inevitable. With manufacturing corruption and bribery within the democratic elements of Komi, we will hasten their downfall and expose them for what they would turn into."
 NIK_zcoup_silence_the_unswayed_desc:0 "There are those who remain who do not share the same vision as us. No, to go a step further, they seek to ruin, torment and corrupt our vision into something else. We will not allow ourselves to be destroyed by reactionary elements. Many times has this happened in history, but it will not happen here. These voices who wish to bring Komi to ruin will be brought down.\n\nAnd such dissent will be silenced forever."
 NIK_zcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_people_desc:0 "At last, the revolution has been established! We have safeguarded its existence, and no more will we have to worry about a counter-revolution, or any menace that will taint Zhdanov's vision of a pure, socialist Russia. With the support of our people, nothing will halt Komi's advance. No capitalist or fascist will be allowed to stand in our way. With Zhdanov at the helm, and the countenance of the government, Komi will be unbreakable!\n\nNow that we have ridden ourselves of any guilts, regrets, and mistakes of the past, there is only one path to take.\n\nForward!"

 NIK_bcoup_bukharinas_coup_desc:0 "코미가 혼란에 빠져들자 스베틀라나 부하리나는 이 혼란을 기회를 보고 공산당을 이끌어 정부를 장악했습니다. 하지만 이 통제는 믿을 수 없을 정도로 취약하며 우리의 반대편에 의해 뒤집힐 위험이 존재합니다. 코미의 혁명이 성공할 수 있도록 신속히 대처해야 합니다!"
 NIK_bcoup_the_legitimate_option_desc:0 "20년 전만 해도 소련은 나치 위협으로부터 시달려왔습니. 그러나 서러시아 혁명 전선이 서러시아 전쟁의 끝날때까지 서러시아에 대한 지배권을 유지한 것처럼, 이것이 러시아에서의 공산주의의 종식을 의미하는 것은 아닙니다, 우파들의 주장에도 불구하고 코미가 진정으로 혁명적인 깃발 아래 있지 않은 것은 불과 몇 년밖에 되지 않았습다. 이 모든 것을 고려하면 공산주의 아래의 코미가 정통성을 가진 유일한 코미라는 것은 명백한 사실입니다. 우리의 정당한 대의명분인 이러한 사실들을 인민들이 알리기 위해 우리는 코미의 가장 고립된 시골지역까지 멀리까지 이 사실을 방송할 것입니다!" 
 NIK_bcoup_fully_seize_the_party_desc:0 "코미를 완전히 통제하고 더 많은 혼란을 막기 위해서는 우선 공산당에 대한 통제권을 확보해야 한다. 부카리나가 당의 과반을 장악하고 있지만, 여전히 혁명과 부카리나에 충성하지 않는 사람들이 있다. 이들은 주로 즈다노프파들이며 어떤 변화도 반혁명적이라고 보는 정통파 공산주의자들도 있다. 물론 당의 이념적 차이를 넘어 내부로부터 우리를 깎아내리려는 기회주의자들이 있다. 우리는 내분을 피할 수 있도록 이념적 반대자들과의 공통점을 찾으려고 노력할 수 있지만, 공산주의를 사실상 파멸로만 이끄는 당내의 모든 사람들을 찾아내고 처리할 수 있도록 세심하게 조사해야 할 것이다."
 NIK_bcoup_propaganda_blackout_desc:0 "코미의 거리 전체에 걸쳐선 선전과 전파가 퍼지고 있습니다. 그 중 대부분은 우리의 선전이지만 나머지 선전물은 중도파와 우파들이 인민들을 자기 편으로 끌어들이기 위한 절박한 시도에서 나온 것이다. 어떤 경우에도 우리는 이런 일이 일어나도록 내버려 둘 수 없다. 이러한 선전선동에 대항하기 위해서 우리는 가능한 한 어떤 방법으로든 그것을 소멸시킬 것 입니다. 거리에서 우리는 우리의 추종자들에게 반동적인 포스터를 철거하도록 고무시켜 우리가 가능한 모든 전선에서 그들과 싸울 것임을 보여줄 것이다. 우리는 포스터나 다른 물리적 선전에 반대하는 집회를 하는 동안, 우리는 기술을 활용하여 반동주의자들의 선전과 라디오 방송국을 찾아내 제거할 것입니다. 운만 따라준다면 혁명에 대한 위협도 끝낼 수 있겠죠."
 NIK_bcoup_we_are_benevolent_desc:0 "옛날, 마르크스는 공산주의라는 유령에 대해 썼습니다. 그는 그것이 전 유럽을 괴롭히고, 모든 것을 두려움에 떨게 한 동화라고 말했습니다. 구소련의 존재에도 불구하고 이 유령은 노약자부터 청년까지 코미의 많은 사람들을 괴롭히고 있습다. 따라서 현재 코미의 혼란에도 불구하고 우리는 자비로운 세력임을 국민에게 보여줘야 한다. 힘들 수도 있지만, 우리는 어떤 식으로든 싸움에 휘말린 사람들을 도와야 한다. 이런 시대에 국민에게 손을 내밀어 도와줌으로써 우리 또한 도덕적으로 높은 지위의 이익을 얻을 수 있으며, 결국 코미의 다른 정당들은 이런 위기상황에 있는 사람들에게 자신의 자원을 쓰려 하지 않을 것이다. 인민들은 우리의 생명줄이며, 우리는 그들을 지지해야 합니다!"
 NIK_bcoup_fight_to_save_us_all_desc:0 "코미는 국민에 대한 여러 가지 위협이 있는 곳입니다. 세로프와 샤파레비치의 파시즘이든, 아니면 스탈리나의 이른바 '민주주의'든 사회주의 불씨를 끄집어내고 인민을 영원한 어둠 속에 빠뜨리려는 위협은 수없이 많습니다. 어떤 상황에서도 우리는 이런 위협이 발생하도록 내버려 둘 수 없다. 물론 우리는 지금 현재 이러한 존재들이 우리의 안전과 자유에 대한 지속적인 위협라는 것을 인민들에게 확실히 알려야 한다. 결국 지금 자신의 처지를 잘못 알고 있는 것은 국민에게 아무런 도움이 되지 않을 것이니깐요. 코미의 모든 국민을 위해, 아이들부터 노인까지, 우리는 그들의 자유를 위해 싸울 것입니다!" 
 NIK_bcoup_make_peace_where_we_can_desc:0 "코미에는 안정되기 위해서는 제거해야 하는 요소가 많지만, 우리와 협상할 수 있는 요소도 많습니다. DSNP에서 Zhdanov의 옛 연락책들 중 일부는 협상을 통해 우리 편으로 넘어올 수 있기를 희망 할 수 있으며, 또한 싸움에 관련된 모든 사람들이 그들의 특정한 이념만을 위해 전적으로 헌신하지는 않을 게 할 것입니다. 올바른 방송과 선전과 함께, 반동분자들에 대한 지속적인 승리와 함께, 우리는 바라건대 점점 더 많은 적을 제거할 수 있을 것이다. 능숙한 계책으로 우리는 바라건대 이곳 코미의 공산주의에 대한 많은 위협 중 일부를 평화롭게 끝낼 수 있을 것입니다!"
 NIK_bcoup_make_war_everywhere_else_desc:0 "모든 사람을 상대로 평화적으로 협상 할 수 있는 것은 아닙니다. 여기 코미에는 반동주의자가 너무 많아 완전히 파괴해야 할 경우도 역시 많습니다. 그들이 식팁카르의 거리에 숨어 있든, 시골에 숨어 있든, 이런 반동주의자들 누구라도 존재하도록 허용하는 것은 정부가 다시 타도 당할 것을 부탁하는 것과 같습니다. 우리는 그들의 반동적 위협들을 파괴하고 뿌리뽑기 위해 노력해야 합니다. 게다가, 우리는 그들의 지지 기반을 약화시키면서 그들이 내뱉는 헛소리를 끝내기 위해 그들의 라디오 방송국을 파괴 해야 합니다. 이렇게 시간이 흐르면 우리는 스탈리나, 샤파레비치든, 반동적 지도자들을 한 번 그리고 영원히 찾아내고 돌볼 수 있을 것이다. 자유의 혁명적인 불꽃은 이런 머저리들에 의해 결코 꺼지지 않을 것이다!" 
 NIK_bcoup_out_of_harms_way_desc:0 "코미에는 폭력에 넘쳐 있다. 폭력이 줄어들려면 시간이 걸릴 것으로 보이는 만큼 국민 보호에 힘을 쏟아야 한다. 정치적 지원의 필요성으로 이를 정당화할 수도 있겠지만 결국 코미의 많은 국민은 그저 행복 속에서 살기를 바라는 무고한 민간인이다. 정당한 이유에서라도 그들을 총에 맞아 쓰러지게 하는 것은 역겨운 일이다. 그들은 자신의 삶이 혼돈으로 가득차길 요구하지 않았는데, 왜 그들은 다른 사람들이 저지른 일에 대한 결과와 마주해야 하는것인가? 민간인을 보호하는 데는 자원이 들겠지만, 결국 우리가 대표하는 사람들을 보호하지 못한다면 우리가 진정으로 그들의 구세주인가?"
 NIK_bcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_soviets_desc:0 "소련의 깃발은 러시아 인민들에게 많은 것을 가져왔다. 그것은 산업화, 진보된 편안함, 그리고 현대성을 가져왔다. 그러나 가장 중요한 것은 그것이 인민들에게 자유를 가져다 주었다. 코미 공화국이라는 재앙은 국민들로 하여금 이러한 자유를 잃게 만들 뻔 했다. 그러나 부하리나가 코미에 대한 지배권을 굳히면서 국민의 자유는 점점 더 커질 것으로 보인다. 스탈리나의 반쪽짜리 민주주의도, 샤파레비치의 파시즘도 없을 것이다! 아니, 인민의 쇠사슬이 영원히 끊어진 채로 남아 있을 것임을 나타내는 소비에트의 귀환만이 남아 있을 것이다!"

 NIK_comexpansion_the_revolution_secured_desc:0 "Despite the efforts of the reactionaries, communism in Komi has survived. We have managed to weather the coups and counter coups, survived deception, and have even seized power! With the stabilization of Komi, the time has come to look outwards. For too long, Russia has remained divided, split between countless warlords. We will end this chaos and anarchy by first bringing the warlords in our region to heel, then the ones in the rest of Russia. The reactionaries throughout Russia may think the flame of revolution extinguished, but they are wrong, for it has only just begun to burn!"
 NIK_comexpansion_unearth_our_caches_desc:0 "When the Front collapsed and the German bombings increased, a decision was made to hide a large amount of weaponry away, so that a stray bomb or two would not leave Komi bereft of weaponry. Now, with the bombings over, we can begin the process of opening up the caches. Some of the equipment may have been destroyed or stolen, but the majority of the caches that we've opened up to now still have functioning weapons. The access to new equipment will allow us to continue the process of upgrading the army, allowing us to be more ready to begin the process of reunification!"
 NIK_comexpansion_begin_the_rebuilding_desc:0 "After so many years, the German bombs have finally stopped falling. While we weren't able to immediately begin rebuilding, due to the chaos that enveloped Komi, the time has come to fully utilize all of the resources Komi has to offer. We can begin the paving of more roads to reach even the deeply rural lands. Furthermore, we can rebuild the train stations and railroads, and use them without the expectation that they will be destroyed in a matter of weeks, allowing us to transport more resources across Komi at a quicker rate. While one could argue there are many new options open to us, an infrastructure drive is the most pressing matter to complete, as a country is nothing without infrastructure."
 NIK_comexpansion_establish_a_true_army_desc:0 "During the chaos in Komi, we were forced to lean on our militias and the elements of the Republican Army that were loyal to us. However, even though we now control the military, the fact of the matter remains that the military is defensive in nature. To embark on a grand campaign to unify Russia now with our current military would only lead to failure. Therefore, it is clear that we must revamp and reform the military into the Komi Red Army, so that it can not only defend us from threats, but help us push aggressively against our enemies and unify Russia!"
 NIK_comexpansion_reliable_commissars_desc:0 "While we are in no danger of a countercoup, the fact remains that Komi isn't exactly the most stable of places. Furthermore, we cannot rely on a large number of the politically educated officers due to the fact that many of them were educated against communist ideals. We must begin building a cadre of new political officers, ones that are fully trustworthy, in order to not only prevent an ideological schism between the government and the army, but also so that we can maintain control and stability here in Komi by preventing the army from maintaining sympathies to our enemies."
 NIK_comexpansion_soviet_training_desc:0 "While we have done our best to train the army, the undeniable truth is that we are not up to par. Many of the other warlords have been able to lean on training schools or various generals in order to maintain a more professional standard. In order to rectify the situation, a decision has been made to utilize the old Soviet training schools to help rectify the deficiencies of our army. It may take time for the results to truly be felt, but it is a necessary decision, as the army requires modernization and proper training to make it a force strong enough to unify Russia."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_road_to_archangelsk_desc:0 "Out of all the warlords of Western Russia, the West Russian Revolutionary Front is one of the few that could be considered an ally. While the WRRF is ruled by the military, as compared to our civilian rule, it is still a believer in the ideals of communism. In order to take advantage of this possible alliance, we should send an envoy to the WRRF in an attempt to open up relations. There are fears that the Front may see us as an enemy, as Komi did technically split from it after the West Russian War, but the Front likely needs an ally in Western Russia as much as we do. Cooperation with the Front will see us to victory!"
 NIK_comexpansion_a_pact_with_the_front_desc:0 "Thankfully, our diplomatic outreaches to the Front have been well received, and Grand Marshal Zhukov willing to begin coordinating with Komi. This is, frankly, a stunning victory for Komi, as we now have the support of the old Soviet Red Army, along with access to their materials and equipment. The strategic gains are immense, as not only is our northern flank secure, but we have the upper hand from a diplomatic and a military point of view. We will have to increase our cooperation further with the Front in order to obtain the full benefits, but as long as they are willing, our goals of uniting Western Russia become much easier."
 NIK_comexpansion_an_equal_ally_desc:0 "The nature of our cooperation with the WRRF has been debated amongst the Party. Some believe that Komi is doomed to be subsumed by the Front, while others believe that we must wrest control and reassert civilian control over the military. While civilian control is admirable, the fact of the matter is that the Front has been functioning independently for a long time. To demand that they submit to us immediately would only cause strife with our only ally. No, the proper solution is to stand hand in hand as equal allies who both wish to see Russia liberated from the reactionaries that plague it. Of course, in the future, we may be able to revisit the possibility of fully integrating the Front, but that time is not now. Now, we must look to fighting our mutual enemies."
 NIK_comexpansion_shared_training_exercises_desc:0 "While we have tried our hardest to train our new Red Army based on old Soviet techniques, our lack of access to writings on said techniques has hampered our army's growth of skill. In order to rectify this, we have proposed to Grand Marshal Zhukov the idea of joint training exercises through officer exchanges to allow both the Front's and Komi's army to gain experience from one another. While the Front is likely the more skilled of the two armies as of now, the assistance provided will greatly assist our Red Army in being able to successfully fight against the various warlords arrayed against us."
 NIK_comexpansion_march_as_one_desc:0 "For a very long time, Komi stood alone. A bizarre and antagonistic relationship with the Front, who saw Komi as a splitter that contributed to its loss in the West Russian War. However, those days are long gone, as Komi and the WRRF now stand closer than ever. However, we must ensure that we are truly comrades by signing a mutual defense agreement. This will solidify our alliance, and allow both sides to truly be able to assist the other in the upcoming reunification wars, as an attack on the one will mean an attack on the other. With our northern flank hopefully secured, we can begin to fight the other warlords without fear of a surprise attack. The reunification of Western Russia is at hand."
 NIK_comexpansion_an_icy_reception_desc:0 "It seems, for some bizarre reason, that the WRRF has rejected our efforts to begin cooperation with them, and they have sent our envoy home. Due to this, we have no choice but to assume that the Front is a hostile force, adding one more enemy that must be conquered in order to reunite Russia. It is likely that the Front considers us traitors due to Komi's separation from them after the West Russian War. In any case, it doesn't matter. While the loss of the Front as a potential ally is big, it is not deadly. We must take efforts to ensure that if the Front is to invade, that it is us who will come out on top, not these traitors to solidarity."
 NIK_comexpansion_bunkers_to_the_north_desc:0 "While it would be nice to assume that the Front will be passive, it is highly likely that they are mobilizing in an effort to reunify Russia under their own banner. As we border them, it is therefore highly likely that we will be one of, if not the first target of the Front. We need to ensure that our northern border can withstand an attack long enough for us to mobilize the majority of our forces. The best way to ensure this is by building bunker complexes all along the Sysola. The creation of these bunkers should allow us a suitable defense in case of a conflict, allowing us to protect Komi from the splitters to the north."
 NIK_comexpansion_spread_confusion_desc:0 "The WRRF, despite its opposition to us, is still ideologically backed by the ideas of communism. Therefore, it is highly likely that there are many in the Front who are opposed to its opposition towards Komi. We must capitalize on this by spreading propaganda throughout the Front, secretly, about how it has betrayed the revolution in its darkest hour by turning against a government led by a communist party. Furthermore, we must sabotage the infrastructure and mines of the Front, in order to weaken them. This dual pronged effort of spreading confusion shall hopefully lead to the Front becoming more divided, preventing them from attacking us, and making a campaign against them easier."
 NIK_comexpansion_watching_our_rear_desc:0 "While we can't array all of our forces in defense against the WRRF, it would be remiss to leave the border with them completely undefended. Our recent bunker building efforts have allowed our defensive capabilities to increase, but it is obvious that we must do more. Patrols will increase along the Sysola, and we shall increase observation efforts so that our rear is secured. This increased presence should hopefully deter the Front from attacking, and even if they are to attack, our even greater defenses should prevent them from gaining any significant ground, and inflict a large amount of casualties."
 NIK_comexpansion_a_safe_north_desc:0 "Ever since the West Russian War, Russia has been polluted with countless petty warlords, all proclaiming themselves to be the true savior. No more. The time has come to bring this age of warlordism to an end, and restore the red banner of communism! We must begin to move against the local warlords, bringing them under our rule. Plans must be organized, troops must be moved, and bureaucracy must be ready to help integrate the new territories, as there may very well be resistance to our rule. It may very well be a long struggle before we are able to complete reunification, but we do not, Russia may very well be left in this anarchy for eternity, which would truly be a tragedy."
 NIK_comexpansion_against_the_tsarists_desc:0 "The collapse of the WRRF brought many different warlords to power, many claiming to be the "true" Russia. One of the most egregious warlords of them all is Vyatka. These Tsarists seek nothing but the re-implementation of monarchism, the system that crumbled under its own weight back in 1917. The Vyatkans are directly to our south, which means that they are undoubtedly the biggest threat as of right now to Komi. We cannot afford to let this menace fester on our border, or else we risk our destruction by these reactionaries. We must seek to exorcise these Tsarists from Russia once and for all, so that we can finally be free from the specter of monarchism!"
 NIK_comexpansion_build_the_line_desc:0 "A war with Vyatka will be anything but easy. It is likely that it will take time for us to fully breach their lines, and therefore we must construct defenses of our own. We must begin to construct fortifications along our bank of the Vyatka river, so that even if we're not able to immediately storm the Tsarist lines, we have a backup plan that will allow us to hold against their armies. This defensive line shall include trenches, bunkers, and observation outposts, everything we need to defend against Vyatka if need be. However, this line of defense, while comprehensive, will not be maximized to its fullest potential, as we need the resources to contribute to the war itself, not just defensive structures."
 NIK_comexpansion_ready_the_south_desc:0 "In order to launch a successful campaign against Vyatka, we need to ensure that we are ready for the war. To this end, we must begin a mobilization effort focused on the south of Komi, so that we have enough troops to actually fight the Tsarists. We will ensure that our troops are able to get into position for this war. Furthermore, we will send our army engineers to the Vyatka river in order to find the best location to cross it. Our generals have determined that crossing and securing the Vyatka river will be the critical priority early in the war, so to improvise a river crossing would be deadly to our war effort. We must be ready to strike down the Tsarists!"
 NIK_comexpansion_attrition_preparations_desc:0 "The Vyatka Army is one of the most powerful in western Russia, and a war against them risks the possibility of devolving into a long and bloody struggle. If this is to happen, we do not want our troops to starve, as that is how one loses a war. To prevent this outcome from occurring, we must begin to stockpile supplies. Armories will be expanded, and food will be preserved to the best of our ability, so that our army can survive a protracted war. We will also make sure that our soldiers have access to adequate clothing depending on the climate. Even if the war with Vyatka lasts for a long time, our efforts ensure we will come out on top!"
 NIK_comexpansion_second_october_desc:0 "All of our efforts in preparing have succeeded, and the time to begin the war against the Tsarists has arrived. We will not allow monarchism to once again take root in Russia! Our troops will cross the Vyatka river and begin the war against Vyatka. Just as our comrades did in 1917, we will strike down the Tsar from his throne!"
 NIK_comexpansion_the_monks_in_our_sights_desc:0 "One of the first targets identified by our generals is the Order of Saint George. These fanatical monks rule a fairly small amount of land, and aren't backed by any other warlord militarily. As this will be a forward offensive, we must ensure that the army is ready for such a task. Troops shall be moved into position, but more importantly, we must educate the soldiers on the monk's fanaticism. We must make sure that they understand the flaws of the monks' belief, and just how far they could go in order to make sure that we lose. Our briefings will allow the soldiers to be able to quickly snuff out any pockets of resistance that may exist, as they will understand the madness of the monks."
 NIK_comexpansion_attack_gayinsky_desc:0 "The time has come to attack the Order of Saint George and secure our right flank! Our generals expect the campaign to be short and not too difficult, as the Order is a fairly small warlord, and our army is grossly superior to theirs. In any case, let us push onward for a reunited Russia!"
 NIK_comexpansion_seize_their_wealth_desc:0 "As we expected, the Gayny monks had managed to acquire quite a lot of religious paraphernalia. However, we did not expect that the value of said paraphernalia to be this high. There is a huge amount of rare and valuable resources, such as gold, stashed away in places where the monks hoped we'd never look. Sadly for them however, some of the people we captured were all too willing to show us where these valuable items were. This wealth will be very useful in funding our efforts to reclaim Russia. We can even use some of this wealth to help fill the treasury! While there might be some more religious people mad about us selling off church property, the fact of the matter is that this money goes to a just cause: the reunification of Russia."
 NIK_comexpansion_reclaim_our_sister_republic_desc:0 "If Komi had a sister, Vologda would be it. Both Republics have attempted to be something approaching neutral, and Komi-Vologda relations have never been horrible. Now that we have begun our efforts to reunite Russia, it is critical that we attempt to reclaim Vologda in some way. It is certainly possible, given deft negotiations, that we could peacefully integrate Vologda, but a peaceful integration requires both sides to be willing to integrate, something that the Vologdan government may not be willing to do. We must prepare to, in some form, annex Vologda."
 NIK_comexpansion_a_peaceful_option_desc:0 "War is a bloody endeavour. While it is inevitable that we will have to fight in order to secure our control over Russia, we must try our hardest to achieve our goals diplomatically if possible. After all, conflict is costly, and we will need all the money we can spare. In order to integrate Vologda into the Komi Soviet Republic, we must send a diplomatic mission to Vologda to propose integration. This mission will showcase to the Vologdans that we are willing to come to a consensus where no blood has to be spilled. Of course, the mission will also be sure to remind them of the power of the Red Army. After all, the Vologdans may need some convincing in order to be won over."
 NIK_comexpansion_welcome_our_comrades_desc:0 "It seems that our negotiations have succeeded, and Vologda has agreed to join us! We shall begin the process of integrating the Vologdan army into our own, and the leaders of the government have begun the process of ensuring that integration into the Komi Soviet Republic goes smoothly. This peaceful integration is truly a great boon to us, as we can access the full wealth of these lands without needing to rebuild them, leaving us much better off for our future wars."
 NIK_comexpansion_neutrality_is_suicide_desc:0 "Why should we enter negotiations with traitors? These Vologda bastards sold out Russia for the sake of their so-called "neutrality". Even if they agree to peaceful integration, who's to say that they won't betray us at the worst possible moment? Besides, their neutrality has only made them servants of the fascist cause, and therefore not the type of people we want involved with the government in any capacity. We must prepare our troops to conquer Vologda and liberate the people from these fascist servants!"
 NIK_comexpansion_no_mercy_for_splitters_desc:0 "Vologda is nothing but a splitter state, and must be conquered. Our troops are in place, and our supplies are ready for us to march against Vologda. We will conquer this so-called "neutral" state, and liberate its people from the chains they are bound in! The time for war against Vologda is now!"
 NIK_comexpansion_consolidate_our_territory_desc:0 "Our rapid gains of new lands, whether through peace or war, have left the administration overextended. While we have theoretical control over a fairly large chunk of western Russia, the fact is that there are still many pockets within our territory that operate freely, possibly even against Komi! We must rectify this situation now, before we march against the rest of the warlords. More funding and manpower will be devoted to not only keeping the peace everywhere in our lands, but also to our new regional administrations. With the increase of workers and money, the new administrations should be able to begin the process of truly consolidating the new lands, bringing them thoroughly under our control."
 NIK_comexpansion_replentish_the_armory_desc:0 "Our recent wars have left our weapon supplies dangerously low, and it is clear that we need to restock, or risk supply shortages. We must audit all of the captured equipment, and see what can be of use to us. Furthermore, we need to start up new weapons factories and restart the old ones, so that we do not run out of ammunition or rifles at a critical juncture. While this does require us to move our military to a defensive posture for now, it is necessary so that we can succeed in conquering the warlords!"
 NIK_comexpansion_ensure_industrial_effectiveness_desc:0 "In our conquests, we managed to seize control of a large amount of factories, all in varying states or readiness. While we've been able to get some of them up and running again, there are still many that still need to be properly restored and restarted. We must focus our efforts on ensuring that these factories can not only function, but function productively. We will also ensure that these new factories have workers who understand the power of communism, as to prevent any saboteurs wreaking havoc."
 NIK_comexpansion_satisfy_the_peasantry_desc:0 "The majority of people in Russia are peasants. While there are many who still support us, there are also many who have been corrupted by reactionary propaganda. We must show the peasants that we are a benevolent force, and not a spectre that seeks to ruin their lives. We will accomplish this task by providing the peasants with the modern equipment that we can, so that their lives become easier. Furthermore, we will ensure that the peasants have access to modern amenities and methods of communication, improving their standards of living. Hopefully, these efforts will show the rural people of Russia that we only seek to better their lives, not cast them into hell!"
 NIK_comexpansion_relocate_the_party_desc:0 "With our recent conquests, multiple people in the party have advocated for the relocation of the capital from Syktyvkar to Rykov. While Rykov is a more central location, which would allow us to govern easier, the fact of the matter remains that relocation of the party is a costly endeavour. We would have to stage such a relocation so that our government couldn't be wiped out in a single blow, and the capital would be closer to our enemies. However, there are many who argue that despite the costs, the benefits of moving to Rykov would be immense in the long term. We must resolve this debate now, before we must direct resources into more wars against the warlords."
 NIK_comexpansion_make_good_on_our_deal_desc:0 "When we struck our deal with the Front, an agreement was made to begin the process of integration once Vyatka, Vologda, and Gayny were handled. Now, with their military defeat, the time has come to begin integration! We wholeheartedly expect for the Front to follow through on their end, although there are a few who believe that they will sell us out. In any case, let us reach out to the WRRF to begin the process of integration!"
 NIK_comexpansion_the_kirov_conference_desc:0 "As expected, the Front is willing to begin integration talks. While both sides agree in integrating, the details of this unification need to be hashed out. Therefore, we shall host talks between the Front and Komi in the city of Rykov, in order to ensure integration happens smoothly. It is generally agreed upon that Komi will lead the civilian side of the government, while the Front will integrate into and lead the Red Army. With luck, integration will happen smoothly, and we will be ready to smash the rest of the west Russian warlords!"
 NIK_comexpansion_integrate_their_generals_desc:0 "The WRRF, more than anything, is a state led by its generals. It was Voroshilov who led the Front during and after the West Russian War, and it was Zhukov's rule that allowed Komi and the Front to unify. Therefore, it is very important that we commission the generals of the Front under our Red Army. While symbolic, it shows that the military will bow to civilian authority when it is present, which is a very important precedent to set. Furthermore, this integration of the generals allows us full access to people with a very high level of military acumen, which we desperately need if we are to reunify Russia. Let us bring in the generals of the Front into the fold!"
 NIK_comexpansion_merge_the_bureaucracies_desc:0 "The last step in integrating with the Front is to merge our bureaucracies. As the bureaucracy is a civilian job, it shall fall under our control. There is no need for us to drastically change it, seeing as it is of a sufficiently revolutionary nature already. Furthermore, Zhukov has managed to root out any corrupt bureaucrats that may have appeared after the West Russian War. All that is left for us to do is to reorganize the districts, and ensure that the bureaucracy of the Front reports to us. Through deft negotiations, we have managed to gain the power and might of the WRRF! Now, let us finish bringing the Front into the fold, and move against the remaining warlords!"
 NIK_comexpansion_the_backup_plan_desc:0 "It seems that our worst nightmares have come to pass, as the WRRF has declined our offers of integration. It is obvious that the Front seeks to conquer Komi, gaining power in the process, as there is no other reason for them to suddenly decide to turn against us, their allies. Thankfully, we have a backup plan: war with the Front. We must quickly begin to move our troops into position, so that we are ready to destroy the traitors to the north. Of course, we must also attempt to keep these actions as secret as possible, so that they cannot properly respond to our military. The armies of the Front may be experienced, but with luck, we can destroy this upstart military junta before it destroys us."
 NIK_comexpansion_cut_radio_lines_desc:0 "Since we were the closest nation to the WRRF, they relied upon our radio lines and networks for communication for the outside world. Let us cut these lines, depriving them of this network. Such an action will undoubtedly confuse them, as a sudden vanishing of contact tends to do, leaving them scrambling at a critical juncture. Furthermore, it seems that some of their border forces relied on our networks to reach Arkhangelsk, so our destruction of this contact will allow us to assault the border, leaving their soldiers unable to get in contact with their superior officers which prevents our troops from meeting opposition until we have advanced further into the country."
 NIK_comexpansion_take_down_the_revisionists_desc:0 "The WRRF, despite their noble fight against the Germans, have proven to be nothing more than revisionists. If they are allowed to succeed, Russia will become nothing more than a military junta, backed by the image of communism! We must declare war and put an end to this farce of communism, before they put an end to us! Forward, soldiers!"
 NIK_comexpansion_incorporate_the_frozen_north_desc:0 "Despite the attempts of the Front, the Germans were able to successfully bomb the far north very heavily. Many of the roads and railroads are in ruins, and the towns and cities need to be rebuilt in order to be of any use. It is therefore prudent that we send economic aid northwards. This economic aid will be focused on the Arkhangelsk Oblast, as it has the most potential for development, and was also bombed the most. We shall build new factories, restore the railroads, and modernize the houses. This economic development should allow for the north to quickly become a productive part of the country, allowing for us to have a stronger economic base as we move against the rest of the warlords!"
 NIK_comexpansion_an_ultimatum_to_gorky_desc:0 "While Gorki's consistent raids against the Germans in Moskowien are greatly appreciated, the time has come to bring the tanks back under the fold of the Red Army. We shall send Averin an ultimatum: to integrate with Komi and our Red Army, or face invasion and defeat. Hopefully, Averin is intelligent enough to pick integration, but if he is not, our armies will storm his lands and raise the red banner high!"
 NIK_comexpansion_strike_the_separatists_desc:0 "The Republic of Tatarstan is yet another example of how separatism strikes at the worst possible moment. While they existed as the Tatar ASSR in the Front, they revolted as the Front collapsed, weakening it even more. Knowing this, it is fairly obvious that they have no interest in peacefully rejoining a communist Russia, therefore leaving us with one option: invasion. We shall strike against these separatists and bring them back under the fold!"
 NIK_comexpansion_end_the_roa_desc:0 "The ROA are nothing but collaborators. They may speak of reunifying Russia and 'freeing' it from communism, but the fact remains that they willingly sided with the people who caused this era of warlordism. The time has come to destroy Vlasov's ilk once and for all, so Russia can be free from these traitors!"
 NIK_comexpansion_eliminate_the_syncretists_desc:0 "The Mladorossi of Berezniki are liked by none. Their attachment to monarchism earns them the ire of communists, and their love for socialism earns them the hatred of monarchists. This syncretist ideology will fall to our guns easily, ensuring that these madmen won't have any influence in our Russia!"
 NIK_comexpansion_euthanize_the_abomination_desc:0 "There is one thing that communists, monarchists, and even the ROA can agree on: that the Aryan Brotherhood is an abomination. These idiots seek nothing more than to turn Russia into a mirror image of Germany, dooming it to economic hardship and civil war. For the sake of all the innocent people stuck in their lands, we must invade and exorcise Russia of this horrible menace."
 NIK_comexpansion_end_the_islamists_desc:0 "Bashkiria, much like Tatarstan, split from the Front in its weakest moment, dooming it to collapse. It's fairly clear that our only option when it comes to Bashkiria is to invade, and bring it under the red banner once more, as Tuġan has stated his intention to not rejoin us. Let us strike against these Islamists and bring their people into the fold!"
 NIK_comexpansion_the_west_is_ours_desc:0 "Despite all of the odds stacked against us, we have managed to bring all of West Russia under one banner, a feat not seen since the 50s. However, our conquests, while glorious, were swift, and we must devote our energies towards consolidating our new lands. We must ensure that Perm is scourged clean of the Brotherhood, that the last ROA soldiers are captured, and most importantly, we must end the lawlessness present in our lands. It will be a difficult task, but one that is necessary, as we cannot afford our state to be on the brink of total anarchy."
 NIK_comexpansion_survey_the_republic_desc:0 "If we are to reunite Russia, we need to have access to the full potential of our territory, which is something we lack as of now. While there is some resistance against us, the primary problem is that we lack knowledge on what our resources are and where we can get new resources. Even with us piecing together everything we have, there are still large swathes of our lands that we know nothing about. The time has come for us to conduct a full survey of West Russia. This survey will include the cities, so we can fully understand what needs to be rebuilt, and the countryside, so we can acquire access to new resources. It may take time, but we need it in order to move forward and unite Russia!"
 NIK_comexpansion_raise_the_banners_desc:0 "Most of our new lands were not run by communists, and it shows. There is a fair amount of apprehension towards the government, as people believe that we will collapse like the Soviet Union of old. We must spread propaganda to inform the people that it was not communism's innate weaknesses that ruined Russia, but the insidious Germans who sought to annihilate us. Furthermore, we must try to encourage people to show pride in the Soviet Union. After all, it was under the Soviet Union that there was peace, not the monarchists or the Russian Republic. We shall raise the red banner of communism in every village and town so the people see that we have returned to liberate all!"
 NIK_comexpansion_prepare_our_industries_desc:0 "With our increased access to resources, combined with our new conquests, the time has come to expand our industrial output. Firstly, we must integrate the Kuybyshev industry into our own. Their output must be factored into our planning and industrial production. Secondarily, we must begin to build new factories in our lands. Our access to new resources allows for our industry to diversify, letting us produce different products. With the combination of Kuybyshev industry and new factories, we can be prepared for future wars, and we can support the industrial workers, which is a core part of our mandate."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_viipuri_conference_desc:0 "The time has come. With the unification of West Russia, the time has come to reclaim Onega. As Finland is a powerful nation, especially when combined with our current army, it is probably easier for us to negotiate with them. We will reach out to the Finns and propose to hold a conference in Viipuri over the Onega issue. This will be our first major international negotiation, and no matter what happens, we must show the world that communism is alive and well in West Russia. All of our efforts have built up to this, so let us prove to everyone that Russia is more than an anarchic wasteland!"

 NIK_comexpansion_secure_the_party_desc:0 "While our party maintains a unified and organized front for the rest of the world, internally the party is a mess. Competing sub-ideologies, infighting, and a general lack of cohesion threatens the very foundation of our state. The members of our party should be made to realize who is in charge and how our party is going to be run from now on. All party members are going to have to be brought onto the same page regarding goals, ambitions, and public relations. Our party will be made into a single, unified front under the General Secretary's leadership."
 NIK_comexpansion_a_matter_of_unity_desc:0 "Maintaining unity within the party is of the utmost importance. It was the weakness of Bukharin's communist party that ultimately led to his downfall. If he had been a stronger leader and kept the party together, we may have even won. Keeping unity within the party is vital for keeping the political system functioning, and a necessary component of Lenin's ideology. We must endeavor to further solidify our power base within the party and ensure our continued political hegemony. The party will be kept unified, at all costs."
 NIK_comexpansion_an_orthodox_front_desc:0 "Even under the weak leadership of Bukharin, the Soviet Union thrived in the 20s and 30s. Industry was built, farms thrived, and peace was had, all through the guidance of our superior Marxist-Leninist ideology. It was Bukharin's indifference to strict ideological adherence and Lenin's ideas of constructing a grand army to protect the Soviet Union that led to our defeat. This time will be different, however. The Republic is to remain staunchly orthodox Marxist-Leninist, under the uncompromising rule of the party."
 NIK_comexpansion_move_for_collective_rule_desc:0 "A state being headed by a single person with a strong power-base is nothing but the seeds of a personality cult, and un-socialist. The socialist state must be ruled collectively, by the Party, with the head of state only as a guiding figure. To do otherwise is to invite tragedy, as we discovered so many years ago during the rule of the incompetent Bukharin. What good has ever come of such dictatorial rule? It has only brought pain and suffering upon Germany and Japan, who's empire's creak and groan under their enormous weight."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_mastery_of_suslov_desc:0 "Suslov is the obvious choice to be General Secretary of the Republic. His expert political maneuverings, strict guiding hand, and adept diplomacy are exactly what we need to keep the party in line and politically consistent. Additionally, Suslov has had years of experience in the party, and is easily one of the foremost senior members. That experience in handling matters of state and diplomacy, both within the nation and without, will be necessary in the coming years. He should be the one to take the lead in our political system and guide the nation into the future."
 NIK_comexpansion_step_into_the_light_desc:0 "The moment has come! The title of General Secretary of the newly christened Komi Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic will go to Mikhail Suslov. Suslov, who's many years of service to the Communist Party and vast experience in the political system have more than earned him the position, will finally be stepping into the public eye. His stage is to be that of the entirety of the nation, coming with all the benefits and challenges that will present him. Regardless of what he does in that position or where he goes with it, it is assured that a new chapter is beginning in Komi."
 NIK_comexpansion_a_party_against_the_puppetmaster_desc:0 "Though there are many in the party who romanticize the early years of the Soviet Union before the Germans invaded, it must be acknowledged that orthodoxy failed us in the past. Bukharin didn't fail because he didn't follow Marxist-Leninist principles well enough, he failed because he followed them too strictly. If Suslov is to become the next General Secretary of the Communist Party in Komi, then that will be our doom. He will lead us down the same path of failure we already tried. No, we must instead forge a new path, our own path. The more adaptive members of the Party must start consolidating their own bloc to oppose Suslov's influence."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_connections_of_zhdanov_desc:0 "Andrei Zhdanov is exactly the kind of man we need in charge of the Communist Party today. Not only has he proven himself capable of bridging the gap between the Suslovites and Bukharinites among us, but his ideas have the potential to transform a new Soviet Union into something never before seen. Additionally, his wide net of political connections and allies give him an already strong political base. If anyone has the ability to bring Russia and the Communist Party into the modern era, it would be Zhdanov."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_foundations_of_society_desc:0 "As part of the Party's ideological re-education program, several treatises and works of communist literature have been added to the official required reading lists of the state, now including several of Zhdanov's own works. His works and manifestos are to be featured heavily in the modern political works section, and describe his vision of Communism bringing the Soviet Union into the future technologically and culturally. These works will serve not only to expand our catalogue of reading material, but also to increase Zhdanov's public exposure and popularity base."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_voices_of_the_people_desc:0 "Zhdanov is a true liberal among us! In recent weeks, he has been ramping up his calls for openness and transparency in government, calling the current system not only opaque, but corrupting in nature. Additionally, he has called for further liberalization of speech, arguing heavily in favor of new legislation protecting free speech, and even made some radical calls for involving the people more heavily in government. These calls for citizen participation and transparency in government have done much to increase Zhdanov's influence and popularity."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_ambition_of_bukharina_desc:0 "Svetlana Bukharina, once the newly-elected firebrand of the Komi National Assembly, has slowly begun to rise up the Communist Party's Ranks. It is no surprise that the daughter of the last General Secretary of the CCCP has found intense popularity among the working class of Komi. It is a surprise, however, to see Bukharina deftly navigate the ossified bureaucracy of the KPK.\n\nThe Party is not dumbed to change. When a descendant of one of the greatest revolutionaries in history seeks power, it would be insane to stop them. Bukharina's talent for governance and her obvious charisma in both one-on-one meetings and mass speeches will aid in the Party's march towards Worker's Liberation. This ambitious woman will be our next candidate."
 NIK_comexpansion_a_word_to_the_soviets_desc:0 "It says something about Bukharina's love for the worker that her base is composed of the self-organized directly elected soviets that dot the Republic and low-level agrarian and industrial institutions regulating much of the Republic's industry. However, this is not to say that she does not enjoy broad support, considering that these soviets and institutions are the primary low-level institutions governing local life in the Union.\n\nUnfortunately, the suggestions of the soviets and other minor institutions often go unheard in the Party ideological programme. To ignore the organs of the people is to not represent the people, which goes against the Party's ideology in and of itself. Bukharina will directly appeal to the soviets and integrate their suggestions into the Ideological programme. All must have a voice, from the general secretary to the singular peasant."
 NIK_comexpansion_inspire_soviet_patriotism_desc:0 ""I ask you, as a humble citizen of this great union, are you - should you - be proud to be Soviet Citizens? It is not an unworthy question. We do not live in a perfect society. Poverty, hunger, greed still remains. We should not judge a society by its current conditions. To do so would paint every union in history as a dystopia without opportunity for change. We should judge a society by its ideals, the ideas that tie us together, that march us forward towards a greater future. The fuel for hope, the engine of change.\n\nWould we not live in subjugation if we did not value freedom or liberty, even if our freedom has not been perfected? Would we not live divided and broken without our solidarity, powerless to the machinations of the ruling class? Would we not live poor and destitute, without places to call home or families to love without our ambition for true egalitarianism?\n\nWould we not live in the darkness of ignorance, the fear of the unknown, without our cosmopolitan, worldly nature? These ideals, the ideals of the Soviet citizen, are surely something to be proud of. The act of being a Soviet citizen is an act of bravery in a world of illiberalism and authoritarianism. We live in one of the truly great societies of modern history, as one of the few that never ceases marching forward. For our ideals.""
 NIK_comexpansion_evaluation_of_party_policy_desc:0 "A key moment has arrived in the Party's history. The Party's yearly evaluation has arrived. Historically, the party's evaluation has been either a bellwether of change or an early sign of the continuing reign of orthodoxy. With Bukharina on the rise and reformists ascending in the party's hierarchy, it may seem to be a certain victory for reformists, but Orthodox evaluators still dominate much of the Party's organs.\n\nCertainly many of Bukharina's methods have proved effective, but the old guard watches carefully for signs of instability or progress gone too far. The question remains: shall orthodoxy take hold once again, or will the reformists take ascendancy?"
 NIK_comexpansion_clamp_down_on_revisionism_desc:0 "It seems as if every few years, new challenges emerge against orthodoxy. And every few years, without fail, we defeat these revisionists. The newest threat that has emerged is the challenge posed by Bukharina, Zhdanov and their gang of reformists. They are dangerously out of line, and may be conspiring to seize party organs as we speak. If we do not take proper action, their dangerous ideas will surely grow to an unmanageable popularity.\n\nClamping down is not just the expedient option, but the morally right choice. Only by silencing unnecessary dissent and enforcing democratic centralism will the Party and the Republic achieve our goals."
 NIK_comexpansion_expel_the_revisionists_desc:0 "The revisionists have gone too far! Bukharina and Zhdanov will destroy the party and the democratic foundations of the republic. When factionalists interrupt the march of the party, the dreams of our forebears are destroyed. It is of tantamount importance that in these desperate times, we adopt desperate measures.\n\nWe will expel Bukharina, Zhdanov, and their thuggish gangs from the Party. Once they have been disposed of, we may call new elections. This time, so-called "reformers" will not be allowed to interrupt the proceedings of the Supreme Soviet. Only those who desire the creation of a true socialist and communist state will be allowed to hold such an esteemed position of power."
 NIK_comexpansion_a_reliable_central_committee_desc:0 "The Presidium is secure from splitters. No longer do revisionists offer heretical proposals that spit in the face of Marx and Lenin. Before the Presidium moves forward and forgets the memory of these upstarts, we should begin introducing motions to insure that the matters of the Presidium remain smooth and uninterrupted, and prevent the introduction of any who would seek to corrupt our worker's movement.\n\nNot all will be happy setting into stone what were already de facto bans on reformers, but it is for the good of the Party, the Presidium, the workers, and the Republic. A semblance of order will be restored to our highest legislative body."
 NIK_comexpansion_refined_at_last_desc:0 "There is no doubt that when Marx imagined the foundations of a true worker's state, he envisioned a state not dissimilar to our own. And it is no doubt that when Lenin envisioned the vanguard party of a socialist state, he imagined something not dissimilar to our own Party. However, it would be a disservice to Lenin to assume that Marxism-Leninism was the final evolution of socialist thought. Work done by our most esteemed political scientists and worker's representatives have refined Marxism-Leninism and clarified it so the state can follow it without a doubt of where to go next.\n\nBy defenestrating splitters, revisionists, and the scum that call themselves "reformists". No more mavericks, no more opposition. The Party can now boldly move forward with our great scientific order. "
 NIK_comexpansion_passing_the_bar_desc:0 "In the early history of the Komi Communist Party, reformists were sidelined at every opportunity. Anyone seeking real change within the Party and the larger community were not welcome to speak their thoughts. Fortunately, the party has changed. The reformists, after years of campaigning, protesting, and maneuvering, have "passed the bar". The Party as a whole now approves our actions. Even if our ideology is not yet the official ideology of the Party or even the one backed with the most popular support, the orthodox faction are now the ones being sidelined for the first time in years.\n\nThis development is a monumental point for the development of socialism in Komi. The road is long, but the path is clear. Now, reformists must march on. That is not to say that there will be no opposition - the remnants of the orhodox faction still remain as a potent threat to changes in the system, and they are enraged that their once dominant ideology is no longer ascendant - but it is opposition that we are sure that we can defeat."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_way_of_the_people_desc:0 "Andrei Zhdanov, once a firm second in command in the Communist Party's structure, has risen to prominence as reformists have taken the reins of the Party. His personal ideology, rooted in a libertarian interpretation of communism, has caught fire among local soviets across Komi. In nearly every town, men march through town, yelling Zhdanov's name and touting his loyalty to the tenets of socialism.\n\nZhdanov and his thoughts will lead us into the future. His popularity is unmatched, his populist rhetoric easy to grasp and egalitarian. This is a man who cares for the liberty of the worker and for the basic liberty of any man or woman. This is the man who will lead the Republic into the future, as the popular candidate of the Communist Party."
 NIK_comexpansion_formally_abolish_purges_desc:0 "With Zhdanov's leadership, the Party will soften its stance on those who hold different ideological opinions in the Party. For change to take place - for democratic change to take place - there must be a wealth of different men and women and a vibrant dialogue. The tradition of mass party purges, removing hundreds of people from the party for their ideology, will end. No longer will those who have barely lifted a finger against the party be expelled from it.\n\nIn its place, anybody who is suspected of counter-revolutionary activity or denounced will have an individual inquiry lead by a neutral commission of party members. Without due process, justice ceases to exist. Without questioning, the party ceases to exist."
 NIK_comexpansion_reconcile_the_factions_desc:0 "Any scholar of political history knows the danger posed by factionalism. The ability of a man to tear apart the social order seems to have some grounding in nature, for it is the natural conclusion to every system in history. And yet, our hindsight will allow us to avoid a certain fate. The scientific order of the party will steer us away from factions.\n\nReconciliation, not conflict, is the key to unity. The orthodox faction thinks us betrayers of Suslov's legacy. Our Party diplomats and envoys will assure them that our Visionary faction seeks to advance Suslov's legacy, ideology, and dream, not stomp on it. The party is just as orthodox, if not more orthodox, then it was before Zhdanov's ascendance. No revisionism is tolerated."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_way_of_the_soviets_desc:0 "There is a new path for the Communist Party. This path is grounded in the people, built from the ground up. No longer will the elite of the Presidium and the Politburo ignore the wishes of the people and spit in the face of Lenin. Bukharina offers this new path, a bright new future for the Party.\n\nBukharina's way has a centerpiece in the traditional soviets, the peasant councils that the old Bolsheviks built upon. The Soviets are the mouthpiece of the people, in their numerous opinions and divisions. Almost every Soviet, however, is united in their support of Bukharina. She proposes elevating them to their previous level of prominence. This massive base has manifested its power in grassroots support for Bukharina. She is the People's Candidate, and so she is the Party's."
 NIK_comexpansion_reestablish_the_congress_of_soviets_desc:0 "Before one can work through the nitty-gritty of governance, they must establish the foundations of democratic rule. In the days of the CCCP, the Congress of the Soviets was the legislature of the people, representing everybody from Belarus to the Tajik Republic. Reestablishing the Congress and turning Komi's legislature into a bicameral affair will offer proper representation and further the advance to Socialism.\n\nSurely, it is just a coincidence that the soviets are the state institutions who support Bukharina's policies the most. That is not to say that the Presidium will be modified in any way, but the Congress of Soviets will elect only representatives of local soviets, largely supporters of Bukharina."
 NIK_comexpansion_in_the_name_of_liberation_desc:0 "Social liberation, the unshackling of the minorities, is of chief importance in Bukharina. For millennia, women have been oppressed by men in a horrid cycle of sexism that never seems to end. Without socialist thought, it is not unthinkable that all women could still be relegated to the position they once occupied in pre-modern life. The rise of Bukharina in the Communist Party has shown the power of Marxist thought to overcome reprehensible social norms. For the first time in history, a woman seems poised to take formal control of the Republic.\n\nHowever, the oppression of women is not the only form of social oppression in the Republic. The disabled, those with mental and physical disabilities, are shunned from their families and find it difficult to find work. People belonging to the Komi ethnic group find it difficult to advance in career fields and face a great deal of inequality with their Russian brethren.\n\nWhile most of the population are staunch believers in the Orthodox Church's teachings, there are a few thousand Muslims, old believers, and Komi native religious believers who are forced to live in small segregated communities and are discriminated against in such innocent acts as crossing the streets.\n\nThe law must not tolerate this. The soviets, both local and national, will legislate against these injustices immediately."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_stars_are_risen_desc:0 "The reformist faction was once relegated to the margins of internal Party politics. It's voice was silenced by orthodox suppression, relentless attack with the party's official ideological platform. No longer are dissident voices suppressed! All oppressed may cry free! The reformists are no longer the "coalition of rising stars" they once were. It is the ruling strand of the party. The orthodox faction are now the ones sidelined.\n\nWith the rapid rise to power comes far more responsibility. The faction - now much of the party - must seize the General Secretaryship, and begin talks to form a formal government to rule the Republic. We may only hope we keep to our ideals as we finally take the reins of power."
 NIK_comexpansion_urge_suslovs_resignation_desc:0 "In the past, Mikhail Suslov had a purpose. He was the glue that kept the party together, a popular figure who nevertheless stayed out of the spotlight. However, one must admit he was staunchly orthodox. His entire career was dedicated to advancing a certain sort of socialism, a certain sort which often came into conflict with Bukharina's brand. To put it frankly, Suslov stands in the way of true liberation. Finally, Suslov is perhaps a little too adept. If he is kept in positions of power, there is no telling what he will do to correct the course of the Party and expel Bukharina from it.\n\nSuslov has one fatal flaw. He no longer has the power. We will send a few party envoys and "encourage" him to resign. Of course, he is not obligated to, per se."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_bureau_of_ideological_analysis_desc:0 "Sinecure is a peculiar word. One might argue, in fact, that the role of a sinecure simply does not exist in Marxist thought. After all, "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs". What harm does a so-called "useless" job bring if each man is entitled to his needs?\n\nThat is not to say that Suslov is receiving a sinecure, as harmless as that would be. In fact, he is to be promoted! A man of his stature should not be relegated to bureaucratic work and party squabbling. A new bureau has been created of which he is the head. This bureau, the Bureau of Ideological Analysis will be one in which Suslov has the sole power to "resolve contradictions between the Party platform and established Leninist doctrine." There is a very real possibility that this bureau may potentially influence some facets of Leninist doctrine in the coming years. It may even lead to some suggestions offered to the Congress of the Soviets! Truly marvelous."

 NIK_zhdanov_enough_of_this_nonsense_desc:0 "Libertarianism has proved ineffectual in tackling the many problems that plague not only komi, but the entirety of Russia. Freedom does not mean anarchy, and the party has unanimously decided that the time has come for a shift in focus: of course, with "shift in focus" we mean "shift in government"\n\nThrough the use of "Revolutionary Decrees" we shall transform Komi into a nation that has the wellbeing of the nation - and not of the politicians - as its foremost priority. Long live Russia! Long live the Soviet Union! Long live Ultravisionary Socialism! Long live Comrade Zhdanov!"
 NIK_zhdanov_the_social_sphere_desc:0 "If we are to maintain ourselves into power, we need to bring the people to our side. Through the Revolutionary Decrees, we seized power from the corrupt politicians, but we also made many promises to the people in order to make them drink from the bitter cup: now we need to decide whether to actually keep our word.\n\nOn one hand, we have no such obligation. We are in power, and we can freely decide what's best for the people of Komi without accounting to anyone. On the other, we know what the consequences of such a choice will be, so we'd better reflect upon the matter carefully..."
 NIK_zhdanov_repeal_the_revolutionary_decrees_desc:0 "The Revolutionary Decrees were nothing but a mean to an end. The end was keeping the people calm while we consolidated our power in the government, and now that our objective has been achieved, we can safely repeal them: the government has the right to break its promises for the good of the nation!\n\nThere will surely be protests, big protests. Still, Zhdanov believes they will fade in the end, because socialism may be a great and beautiful utopia, but in order to make it become reality we need to make sacrifices: the sooner the populace learns this simple concept, the better."
 NIK_zhdanov_a_diversion_for_the_people_desc:0 "Our citizens will surely protest a lot if we don't keep our word. In difficult times such as these, it takes little to spark a civil war, and Zhdanov isn't confident he has the power to quench dissent: for this reason, he has given his assent to the approval of a new welfare system that will bring prosperity to the people.\n\nOf course, this is nothing but a diversion. Well-fed, happy people don't protest when their freedom is taken away, and we have all intention of exploiting such a simple yet important truth: is we need to pay some money to ensure the greatness of the Soviet Union, then so be it!"

In order to strengthen our rule upon the country, we'll need to deal with them: some can be appeased, or even convinced to join us, while others... well it won't be so pretty.\n\nFor the good of the Soviet Union, we need to deal with this matter immediately, or risk serious civil strife when we can't afford it.

In his vision are all the needed steps to take to restore Komi to its former glory, and from such a base reclaim the entirety of the Soviet Union: he leads us, we only need to follow!"
 NIK_zhdanov_a_revolutionary_course_desc:0 "The old Soviet Union lost the war due to its inefficient economy. Bukharin insisted on small industry when what he needed was a strong, centrally-planned economy centered around heavy industry and mass-mechanization: now it falls upon us to mend his mistakes.\n\nBy assessing our resources and forming the needed legal framework, we'll lay the groundwork for our new economy, one where the state leads with a strong and knowing hand amidst the difficult currents of the world!"
 NIK_zhdanov_a_new_five_year_plan_desc:0 "As the first step of our new economic policy, we need to decide where to focus our attention. Over the course of the next five years, we will address several key problems of our state, and drastically improve the condition of our economy. However, due to our scarce initial resources, we'll need to choose where to invest the heaviest part of the funds: the other issues will be tackled after the primary focus has been achieved.\n\nOn one hand, we can devote ourselves to rebuilding our infrastructure network, as without roads and railroads we can't send resources to our industrial hubs. On the other, we could kickstart our industrial sector by building several new heavy industries: from there will come the materials to repair the infrastructure."
 NIK_zhdanov_universal_infrastructure_expansion_desc:0 "Infrastructure has been heavily damaged and disrupted by German bombs and local bandits. In order to bring a modicum of normality in the everyday life, and ensure a constant stream of supplies to our industries, we need to both repair what's broken and replace what's obsolete.\n\nBy creating a dedicated commission tasked with overseeing the state of our infrastructure, we can slowly but steadily improve our situation. From there, everything will improve if given enough time and effort."
 NIK_zhdanov_industrial_lynchpins_desc:0 "Some of our cities, such as Gorky, have great economic value as they are home to well-developed and mostly-intact industrial plants. By making these cities the lynchpin of our production sector, we'll have them produce what the rest of the nation needs to rebuild and improve.\n\nFrom there, just as a heart brings lifeblood to the rest of the body, so will the Soviet Union receive new energy to restore us to our rightful place as one of the greatest industrial powers of Earth!"
 NIK_zhdanov_the_resources_of_the_motherland_desc:0 "Russia is rich with resources, but most of them are still untapped. To make things worse, the war and the Luftwaffe bombings have either destroyed or isolated several important extraction plants: this is putting a strain on our industrias development programs.\n\nIn order to improve our economy, we need to both rebuild and improve our existing facilities, and establish new production plants wherever we can find new ore veins or other important natural resources."
 NIK_zhdanov_urban_resettlement_programs_desc:0 "During the course of the last twenty years, millions of people all across the Soviet Union fled from the cities to avoid bombings, poverty and famine. While the countryside fared no better than the urban areas, at least there was food: now that the emergency is over, we find ourselves with empty factories in the cities and thousands of unemployed in the more rural regions of the country.\n\nIn order to both reduce unemployment in the countryside, and supply our industrial sector with all the workers it needs in preparation for its future expansion, we'll begin a plan of urban resettlement. Young, unemployed men and women in our rural regions will be incentivized - or forced if they refuse - to transfer to the nearest cities, where we'll build new houses for everyone, thus also kickstarting the construction industry."
 NIK_zhdanov_building_the_future_desc:0 "When our leader said he had a vision, he didn't lie. Through his cunning plans and great foresight, we have drastically improved both the economy of the Soviet Union and the lives of the people: production keeps increasing, and now we have functioning infrastructure and well-managed cities filled with industrious citizens.\n\nThere's still much to do before we can truly restore the Soviet Union, but this is a step in the right direction. We are no longer plagued by our past and our mistakes: instead, we are building a tall bridge towards our future! Forward, comrades!"
 NIK_zhdanov_the_peoples_commissariat_of_science_desc:0 "Ultravisionary Socialism is not just a catchy name. We who believe in Ultravisionarism believe first and foremost in the freeing power of science: scientific progress is key to the evolution of mankind, and just as socialism it frees the masses from prejudice and superstition.\n\nIt is only natural that a socialist government is devoted, among many other things, to the pursuit of technological advancement, for the betterment of both the state and its citizens.\n\nTo this end, we shall establish a new People's Commissariat, one where science is not humbled and forced to bend to ideology, but where we, who do not know, bow in front of those who know, or who will find a way for everyone to know."
 NIK_zhdanov_a_vision_for_the_future_desc:0 "If we want to truly claim that we pursue the advancement of science and society, we need to prove it with facts. Our education system is obsolete and underfunded, and most schools desperately need refurbishment, or complete reconstruction.\n\nBy granting more funds to schools and universities, and establishing new, advanced study courses for our superior learning institutes, we will not only pursue our vision of the future: we shall turn it into a reality!"
 NIK_zhdanov_a_psychological_revolution_desc:0 "Psychology has always been overlooked by the capitalist nations. It brings no profit into the pockets of the bourgeoisie and it does not serve to keep the lower classes enslaved, therefore it is useless. We, on the other hand, realize its great potential for the betterment of the people.\n\nBy studying the human mind and its inner workings, we can create a society where the needs of the soul are as satisfied as the needs of the body: by granting true happiness to our citizens, we shall prove the superiority of both Socialist ideology and Socialist science!"
 NIK_zhdanov_experimental_armaments_desc:0 "We may have great plans for the Soviet Union, but our army struggles to match the dimensions of our dreams. With a small manpower pool, and an even smaller industrial base, we can't hope to overwhelm our enemies with sheer numbers. Instead of wasting time in something we can never achieve, we need to focus on the greatest weapon at our disposal: science.\n\nWith our renewed focus on technological advancement, we can create a dedicated research team whose sole focus shall be the development of new weapons. By meeting our enemy on the battlefield armed with overwhelmingly superior equipment, their numbers will melt like snow in summer: socialist science shall pave the way to supremacy!"
 NIK_zhdanov_a_socialist_society_desc:0 "Some might say that we have achieved our dream, that with the reforms we have implemented we have created a society whose greatest aspiration is the pursuit of knowledge. Some misguided fools may even claim that we have created an advanced socialist society.\n\nThey are sorely wrong.\n\nThis is nothing but the start. All that we have done until now is nothing but laying the groundwork for the true scientific revolution. It will be in the next years that we make our dream come true: a socialist future, a truly socialist society... a truly socialist world. Forward!"
 NIK_zhdanov_tractors_for_the_peasants_desc:0 "Our agricultural sector has mostly returned to the Middle Age. Farmers try to get by with what little they can grow in their mismanaged farms, using the tools that their grandfathers used, and the fathers of their grandfathers before them. This is unacceptable: if we truly want to rebuild the Soviet Union to what it was before, we'll need to have a healthy surplus of food for our growing cities.\n\nTo this end, we shall destine funds to acquire modern tractors and industrial farming tools for the farmers. The progressive mechanization of agriculture will not only improve the gross output of our farmland, but also free up more potential workforce for the factories: this way, our society will slowly shift towards socialism by itself!"
 NIK_zhdanov_industrial_farming_operations_desc:0 "Industrial farming isn't just about having tractors and threshing machines. It is about training farmers in the use of modern farming methods, developing more efficient supply routes, building aqueducts to improve field output, selecting more resistant crops and much, much more.\n\nFor millennia, agriculture has been about tradition and chance. In this new age of socialism, we tolerate neither: with new technologies and competent planning, we'll turn our countryside into a productive part of our country, for the betterment of the people, and for the sake of socialism."

 NIK_zhdanov_a_vision_for_the_army_desc:0 "Our Red Army is still a relatively new institution. Formed in the chaos following the coup that brought Socialist rule to Komi, the current military force is only intended to be just good enough to carry out offensive operations without collapsing in on itself due to a lack of organization.\n\nUnfortunately, "good enough" simply won't cut it. The enemies of Socialism grow in strength all around us, and already pose a greater threat than any foe we faced during the unification wars. To better prepare ourselves for the inevitable wars of the future, The Red Army must be restored to its former glory; a professional fighting force that resembles the very same army that once stood on the frontlines against Fascist tyranny many years ago." 
 NIK_zhdanov_lessons_from_the_west_russian_war_desc:0 "The Second Patriotic War, also known as the West Russian War, was the last and most recent conflict involving the united forces of Russia. The Red Army's mighty offensive very nearly broke the back of the Fascists, driving them from the A-A Line and putting their entire front on the verge of collapse. Yet, despite being on the very cusp of victory, military setbacks and traitors alike stole the victory right out of their hands.\n\nWe shall study the various tactics and strategies used by both sides. The Second Patriotic War was in many ways a herald of wars to come, with all parties involved utilizing never-before-seen methods of warfare. The overwhelming offensive launched by the Red Army in particular is worth studying, as well as the Fascists' miraculous recovery."
 NIK_zhdanov_an_army_for_the_world_desc:0 "The world has not become any more peaceful since the period of stagnation that followed the Second Patriotic War, and already the great powers of the world throw their weight around in various proxy wars around the globe. These smaller-scale conflicts have already seen the use of all kinds of tactical innovation. In that case, perhaps it would be prudent to study the strategies used in these wars and find ways to adapt them for our own purposes?\n\nIn particular, the South African War has caught the interest of the Red Army's command staff. This bloody proxy conflict saw bold new concepts such as airmobile infantry and asymmetric warfare used by both sides, and served as a glimpse of what a true modern war could be. The lessons that were demonstrated in the hills and jungles of Africa could very well apply to the forests and tundra of Russia as well."
 NIK_zhdanov_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc:0 "West Russia is united under the red banner once more, but the road to get to this point was bloody indeed. The wars to bring the region under control saw some of the bloodiest fighting since the Second Patriotic War. Despite the Red Army's victory, the constant warfare exposed some serious flaws that will need to be addressed before we continue the reunification.\n\nEach warlord the Red Army crushed used different strategies and organized their forces in a unique fashion. We will take into account all the forces we encountered, and see if we can't incorporate their strengths into our own forces whilst avoiding their weaknesses."
 NIK_zhdanov_an_army_for_the_motherland_desc:0 "It is often said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this was no more apparent than in the Unification Wars. Despite having detailed strategies in place for dealing with our enemies, more often than not unexpected developments would leave our command staff floundering and unable to react in time. All the while, our units on the field suffered while their officers panicked trying to determine what to do next.\n\nThese individual disasters could've been easily avoided had we implemented a more flexible system of unit tactics. More autonomy shall be given to the officers in the field, who will be trusted to improvise should the chain of command break down in the heat of battle. Instead of relying upon orders from on high, officers shall instead count on their own initiative, and the tactics utilized by individual units."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_next_generation_desc:0 "Our efforts are paying off. The Red Army is beginning to closely resemble the very same force that crossed the A-A Line into Fascist-occupied territories nearly a decade ago, finally bearing the makings of a professional military. However, the truth is that we have not gone far enough. Our current Red Army would've been considered top notch in decades past, but is hardly up to modern standards.\n\nThe General Secretary has approved a massive increase in funding for the Red Army, intended to aid with more intensive modernization efforts. No longer shall we lag behind the rest of the world! Through the application of cutting-edge modern technologies and intuitive new tactics, the Red Army shall transform into a force ready to face the modern battlefield."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_kazan_military_academy_desc:0 "Kazan is home to one of nine "Suvorov Schools" that were created during the Bukharin era. These specialized boarding schools were intended to provide young men with a secondary, military-focused education, and as such, many of the Red Army's officers started their careers in these schools. Ever since the unfortunate collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the school in Kazan had gone mostly unused.\n\nWe shall renovate this building and reopen a new institution in its place: the Kazan Military Academy. Rather than being intended for secondary education, this new academy will be created with the express purpose of training new officers for the Red Army. Once Kazan's academy has been reestablished, we can begin creating the next generation of the Red Army's officer corps."
 NIK_zhdanov_doctrinal_refinement_desc:0 "The needs of a modern battlefield change at the blink of an eye, and if one is not careful they can find themselves falling behind the curve sooner than they'd think. Despite our best efforts, however, the doctrines in use by the Red Army are still hopelessly trapped in the past. If action is not taken soon, our enemies would surely run circles around us!\n\nThe time has come to analyze our strategies and refine them to be more suitable for a contemporary conflict. Not only must we bring the Red Army up to modern standards, but we must also keep a sharp eye towards the doctrines of the future. After all, working to maintain a clear advantage over our potential foes is paramount to achieving victory."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_unions_finest_desc:0 "At the end of the day, it is the rank-and-file who make up the beating heart of the Red Army. The soldiers of the Soviet Union were, at one time, legendary for both their devotion to the Socialist cause and their unflinching tenacity in battle. Our own troops are certainly not lacking in either of these aspects, and it would help to further encourage such professional ideals for the new recruits as well.\n\nThe ideal vision of a truly revolutionary soldier must be realized once again. We need able men and women who are willing to undertake any sacrifice necessary for the Motherland, soldiers who would make the Red Army worthy of proclaiming themselves as the strongest!"
 NIK_zhdanov_a_cutting_edge_rifle_desc:0 "The AK-47 is a truly remarkable battle rifle. Capable of firing rifle-sized cartridges at 600 rounds per minute, the Kalashnikov has also gained a legendary reputation for reliability. The rifle can survive a tremendous level of punishment, and is able to survive in even the hardiest of conditions without encountering any sort of problems. On top of all of this, it is easy to maintain and relatively simple to manufacture.\n\nIt is said that you cannot improve perfection, but whoever coined that phrase has obviously never met a Russian weapons designer. We shall begin trials with a variety of new and revolutionary designs, submitted by our finest visionaries and weapons designers. The key to defeating Germany may very well be a cutting-edge rifle!"
 NIK_zhdanov_reorganize_the_war_ministry_desc:0 "With the expansion of our territory comes an unavoidable increase in the number of officers needed by the Red Army's general staff. This would not be too much of an issue if not for the fact that the War Ministry is currently a chaotic mess, virtually unchanged from the days of the Komi Republic. This sorry state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist. The War Ministry must be reorganized from the ground up to better serve the needs of a considerably larger area of operations.\n\nWith some extensive streamlining, it is believed that the chain of command will flow more smoothly. Generals will be able to receive any and all necessary information about combat readiness or battlefield conditions at a moments notice, enhancing their abilities to command our troops."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_new_northern_fleet_desc:0 "We were restricted to a landlocked status during the Komi Republic days, which meant there was little practical need for a naval force. The situation has changed dramatically, however. With access to the sea secured via the critical port of Arkhangelsk, the time has come to organize the beginnings of a new Red Fleet.\n\nWhile the port is frozen over during the winter, it is nonetheless the most important port west of the Urals that still remains in Russian hands. Our navy will be tasked with the protection of this port rather than large-scale naval actions against enemy fleets, as we do not have the capability nor need to build a large armada of ships."
 NIK_zhdanov_revive_the_air_force_desc:0 "We still remember the dark months spent in the shadow of the Fascist terror bombing campaigns. Our only source of salvation was the brave exploits of the Free Aviators, but even they could not be everywhere at once. With the situation in West Russia stabilized for the time being, we must learn to stand on our own two feet in case the Luftwaffe returns to our skies.\n\nThe use of aircraft is nothing new to us, but without a proper military wing of their own, the potential of our wings is needlessly limited. Therefore, an independent air arm of the military, the Red Air Force, shall be created. To aid with the establishment of this new force, we shall expand key airbases under our control to house more aircraft, and begin development of modern aircraft to help dominate the sky."

 NIK_zhdanov_a_vision_for_the_world_desc:0 "The dark days of the warlord era have finally come to an end, and our young nation has climbed out from the abyss to establish itself as a true regional power. In the past, we have had little need for our foreign ministry, as diplomacy in the warlord period usually involved the sword rather than the pen.\n\nThe world beckons. We now find ourselves in need of capable diplomats now more than ever. The foreign ministry must be expanded to meet the requirements of properly conducting international diplomacy, and they shall begin making contact with the nations of the globe as soon as they are able. Let all of the foreign powers know that Socialism has returned to Russia in earnest!"
 NIK_zhdanov_restore_international_trade_desc:0 "While one of the many nations of the world may seek to buid a series of embassies to represent the "governments" of foreign nation, our Federation is not a mere nation amongst equals. Our Federation is in its own league - the seed of a socialist superculture that shall one day grow to encompass most of the world. Thusly, rather than the standard diplomatic practices of most nations, the Paramount Leader has ordered the Foreign Ministry to construct a grand edifice in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] - the Embassy of the Global Proletariat.\n\nThis edifice shall contain representatives of the working class across the world, with delegates that embody the spirit of the working class of each and every nation. While our relations may be limited now, there is no reason to limit ourselves - nations that refuse to send delegates shall be properly represented as well, by Soviet citizens that best exemplify the socialization of the working class within their host nation's civilization. Regardless of their willingness to adhere to our policies, the world shall be represented, in the true spirit of socialist internationalism!"
 NIK_zhdanov_trans_polar_diplomacy_desc:0 "To the untrained eye, the frozen wastes of the Arctic seem like nothing more than an insurmountable obstacle to any kind of fleet, the ice providing an inconvenience for the port of Arkhangelsk in the winter months. While this is not entirely false, the truth is that these frigid waters are among the only remaining gateways into West Russia still controlled by Russians. As such, it would be prudent to foster good relations with the various nations of the north.\n\nWe shall extend an olive branch across the polar territories. Scandinavian countries such as Finland and Sweden are to receive requests for diplomatic recognition, while the very first overtures towards the nations of the OFN shall be sent to Iceland and Canada. No country is outside of our reach, even if they lie beyond the treacherous waters of the Arctic."
 NIK_zhdanov_mission_to_nuuk_desc:0 "In most ordinary circumstances, the Organization of Free Nations would be our greatest adversary. The United States has long established itself the vanguard of predatory capitalism, staunchly opposed to the Socialist cause in every way imaginable. These are, however, not ordinary circumstances.\n\nThe black tides of Hitlerism have washed over Europe, leaving only a path of death and destruction. Even the Soviet Union was not spared from the aggression of the Fascists, and now our very heartland lies at their mercy. We will need allies if we are to overcome this threat, and the OFN are the only international alliance who share this goal. A message shall be sent to the OFN in good faith, requesting their diplomatic recognition. With luck, this agreement shall be the first step towards further cooperation, even if we are hesitant to work too closely with these capitalists."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_scandanavian_mission_desc:0 "Europe lies under a steel wall of Fascism, but there are many ways to pierce this barrier if one knows where to look. In particular, our neighbors in Finland provide a convenient avenue for this purpose. Relations have not exactly been warm due to past tensions, but perhaps it is still possible to reach common ground.\n\nWe will send a message to the Finns with a few polite requests. Firstly, we will ask for diplomatic recognition to further cement ourselves as the legitimate Russian government. Secondly, access to their ports will be requested. Although we control ports of our own, the fact remains that they are frozen over in the winter months, and have no access to the Baltic whatsoever. Land access to Finland's territories would solve this issue quite handily."
 NIK_zhdanov_request_swedish_reconciliation_desc:0 "Sweden is one of the few European nations that has yet to fall under the sinister influence of Nazism, retaining its status as fully independent democracy. Their neutrality during the Second World War may have been seen by some as cowardice, but in the end it meant the complete preservation of their sovereignty.\n\nDiplomacy with the Swedes is paramount to our goals of establishing international relations, especially when one considers their proximity. A fully fledged diplomatic delegation is to be sent to Stockholm, with the goal of requesting their diplomatic recognition. Should they accept, we will be one step closer to establishing our government as a legitimate entity."
 NIK_zhdanov_congratulate_free_norway_desc:0 "It would appear that the iron grip that Nazi Germany has over Europe is not nearly as tight as it seems. Norway was once ruled by an oppressive Nazi colonial government, their freedom cruelly denied by the Germans in their quest for total domination over their neighbors. Miraculously, the situation has made a dramatic reversal.\n\nThe Norwegians have finally thrown off their shackles and removed the Nazi regime from power, establishing an independent government in its place. They are now surrounded on nearly all sides by Fascist influence, and will need all the help they can get. We shall send a delegation to Free Norway offering military assistance in exchange for recognizing our government as the legitimate successor to the Soviet Union."
 NIK_zhdanov_an_english_embassy_desc:0 "Even the proud English people were not spared from the advance of Nazi Germany, and following the Second World War a German-aligned government was imposed upon them. Luckily, it was not to last. The English have overthrown this illegitimate puppet regime and restored an independent state in bold defiance of the Fascists.\n\nTheir struggle is not over however, and many international observers have considered the possibility that the Germans may soon retaliate to reestablish dominion over England. Should this happen, we shall stand with them in the form of military aid. If they recognize our government, we will begin to send them as many weapons and munitions as we can spare."
 NIK_zhdanov_international_socialist_solidarity_desc:0 "With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist International that it had established had fallen into irrelevance, and eventually became defunct altogether. We must rekindle this flame, and create a new entity for encouraging global cooperation.\n\nA new Socialist International has been proposed. Like the ComIntern that came before it, the SocIntern will enable more effective economic and political cooperation between all the socialist parties of the world. Even in these dark times, the SocIntern shall ensure that the revolution will prevail no matter what trials lie ahead. Solidarity forever!"
 NIK_zhdanov_condemn_reactionary_imperialism_desc:0 "The imperialism of the capitalist and fascist powers of the world truly knows no bounds. Greatest of all among the imperial powers of the world is the German Reich, whose conquests have spanned from Africa, to Moscow, to the formerly spotless seas of Luna. Their reckless, genocidal madness has enroached to the territories of the USSR, and imposed brutal, regressive tyranny upon a formerly liberated society. This shall not stand. We shall compose a message directly to Germany, condemning their regressive nature and their horrific imperialism. While we do not expect a reply, to inform them of their inevitable fate is the greatest mercy that we are willing to afford the reactionary invader."

In order to reflect our renewed purpose, we shall disband the Communist Party of Komi and rebuild the Bolshevik All-Union communist Party!\n\nThe VKP(b) will return to the forefront of our politics as we prepare to expand, and it will be the political vanguard of our desire to reunite Russia under the flag of Lenin!"
 NIK_suslov_the_first_reformed_congress_of_the_cpsu_desc:0 "The first congress of the reformed VKP(b) will be the place where we decide the political direction that we'll take in the reconstruction of the Soviet Union. All most prominent members - and of course our leader - will take turns in exlaining their beliefs, and try to convince the assembly to adopt their proposed resolution.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to set our doctrine in stone, and what we decide today will echo in the halls of Moscow when we return there in triumph! Long live the Soviet Union! Long live communism! Long live Lenin!"
 NIK_suslov_ensure_collective_rule_desc:0 "Many misinformed people consider the Soviet Union - and Communism as a whole - as a dictatorial government akin to National Socialism. This is nothing but a lie: in its true form, Communism is collective rule, made by the people and for the people. We have nothing in common with tyrants, be they monarchs or dictators!\n\nIn order to reassure all, both inside and outside Komi, that what we support is not dictatorial rule, but democracy in its truest form, we shall set in stone that our ultimate goal is to create a government where everyone has a say. Whenever a decision needs to be taken, the people and its elected institutions shall vote, and the majority opinion will be followed by all: such is democratic centralism, the true way to social justice!"
 NIK_suslov_the_precedent_of_consensus_desc:0 "While democratic centralism at its core means that the majority rules, this principle must be tempered in the doctrine of Bolshevism, which teaches us that the people must always have their say. We can't claim to be true pursuers of justice if we show disdain for the opinion of the people and its democratically chosen institutions.\n\nTo this end, all decisions taken by the government will be strengthened by a qualified majority of the elective body. It might make our path a bit longer, our pace a bit slower, but we are carrying the freedom of the Soviet people: such a beautiful and fragile thing must be held with all due care, lest it breaks forever..."
 NIK_suslov_the_need_for_decisiveness_desc:0 "The people must always have their say in matters of government, however there are situations in which an expert government sees farther than those it represents. Even good-willed people may act rashly or with poor foresight: in order to put a remedy to such mistakes - even if made in good faith - the government must be able to overrule the elected body.\n\nTo this end, the General Secretary will have the power to veto any decision taken by the Presidium. In order to show our commitment to democracy, the Presidium will be able to overrule the Secretary's veto with a qualified majority of two thirds of its votes. We march to glory, for the Soviet Union!"
 NIK_suslov_audit_regional_parties_desc:0 "In the old times, ethnic minorities within the Soviet Union were organized into Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics. There, they could contribute in their unique way to the advancement of the Socialist cause, safe in the knowledge that their tongue, their traditions and their way of life would not be threatened to be swallowed by the Russian majority.\n\nWith the collapse of the Union, of course the ASSRs were abolished, but this doesn't prevent us from re-establishing them, at least on theoretical ground. Should we ever be able to incorporate lands held by the old minorities in our bid to reclaim Russia, they will return to the old system, granting stability and legitimacy to our rule."
 NIK_suslov_unity_in_ideology_desc:0 "In the old times, people were kept together by obedience to a crown or by brute force. In our enlightened nation, instead, people willingly band together by sharing the same ideology. No nation can stand the test of time if its citizens quarrel on all matters of government: in division lie the seeds of autocracy.\n\nIn order to enact democratic centralism with full efficiency, we shall adapt our ideology to the modern times, removing all obsolete or controversial ideas, and purifying it with our own zeal. The result will become our party line, that we shall carry all the way to Moscow!"
 NIK_suslov_address_offical_standards_desc:0 "Competence is a rare quality in these troubled times. All around us, and sometimes even among us, lurk corrupt, inefficient, disloyal officers, who pursue their own goal above the nation, or are simply too stubborn or proud to admit that they are utterly unable to serve the nation as it deserves to be.\n\nIf we are to be a beacon for the beleaguered peoples of Russia, then we need to excel in all things, including the difficult art of administration. We must choose the best for the bureaucracy, and institute laws and organs that will punish the corrupt and the incompetent as harshly as it is needed, for the good of all..."
 NIK_suslov_a_competent_bureaucracy_desc:0 "It appears that the Soviets, the basic economic unit - and the very namesake - of the Soviet Union, have been getting ahead of themselves as of late. They already elect the Supreme Soviet and the Presidium, and have other duties assigned to them by the law, but they still want more influence over government affairs.\n\nThis is where it ends. Adherence to the law is what defines the Soviet man, not thirst for power. We shall make it clear that the Soviets already have their powers and duties, and that exceeding the mandate of the law is a crime. A very serious crime."
 NIK_suslov_a_commitment_to_socialism_desc:0 "Socialism is the future of mankind. Freed by the shackles of the bourgeoisie, the workers of all the world can - and will - unite, and build a new, perfect world. This is the key tenet of the socialist doctrine, OUR doctrine, and we'll make sure all know it!\n\nRadios, newspapers, every cog in our propaganda machine will be geared towards praising the gospel of socialism, and our commitment to its tenets. By adhering to the socialist doctrine, and slowly perfecting it towards communism, we shall pave the way for the nations of the world to follow!"
 NIK_suslov_a_commitment_to_the_party_desc:0 "As the vanguard of socialism and communism into the world, the Party is the very embodiment of socialist doctrine and purpose. Our government was elected thanks to the efforts of the Party, and from it come our most important and competent advisors and ministers. Denying such a simple truth is akin to madness!\n\nIn order to show our gratitude to the party, the government will make sure to consult it often, and party officials and bureaucrats will receive several additional duties within the government, so that they may integrate even more perfectly our state with our party doctrine."
 NIK_suslov_uplift_progressive_values_desc:0 "Socialism is so much more than merely a political ideology. It is a culture, a set of values to use every day: we can even say that socialism is a way of life, the most perfect in the world! In socialism, the workers work as much as the nation demands, and they receive everything they need to make their lives meaningful and worth living.\n\nWith our renewed emphasis on our socialist roots, we should make sure that everyone understands that socialism is something that permeates their entire lives, not just the electoral urn. To this end, we'll enact a propaganda campaign aimed at exalting socialist values and their contribution to society."
 NIK_suslov_the_new_soviet_woman_desc:0 "For centuries, capitalists and religious leaders have forced the woman to bend to their will, binding their free will and intellect with moral chains and derogative concepts such as "queen of the house" and "naturally destined to motherhood"\n\nIn our free socialist Russia, women are equal to men under all aspects! We shall demand that they do as men, and we shall grant them the same rights and choices any man gets. Farmer, teacher, mother, soldier, secretary general: if they show the attitude, they'll find a way to it!"
 NIK_suslov_proclaim_social_equality_desc:0 "Like hammer and sickle, man and woman are fundamental to socialism, each with their own role. We proclaim the freedom of all workers from the shackles imposed by capitalism and moralism, and the role of the woman will no longer be that of a glorified cook and babymaker!\n\nAt the same, we understand that man and woman have each their own peculiarities. Equality must be tempered by the laws of nature, and while a woman will never be forced to assume a role she doesn't want, we should still incentivize all to follow the path evolution has set."
 NIK_suslov_encourage_the_people_desc:0 "Unlike the autocracies or the false democracies, the Soviet Union is made firstly by its workers and citizens! We are the only ones who truly let the common man and woman participate to the government, and it is extremely important for the health of our political system that as many as possible take interest in politics.\n\nThe socialist revolution and the class struggle are permanent features of our life as long as a single nation on Earth is still ruled by the bourgeois, and all loyal Soviet citizens should fulfill their duty to the cause of Lenin, be it in the factory, on the field of battle or in the hall of the Presidium!"
 NIK_suslov_unity_in_purpose_desc:0 "The old Soviet Union was plagued by infighting. Political deviance was regarded as religious heresy, and many were burned at the stake - some even literally - for a slight deviation from party doctrine. If we want our new Union to stand the test of time, we need to unite rather than divide, and convince rather than force: we won't make the same mistakes as our predecessors, we can't afford it right now!\n\nTo this end, we'll accept all those who truly believe in the socialist cause, no matter their shade of red. In difficult times, we need all the friends we need.\n\nSo long as they learn the true way of Marxist orthodoxy in time."
 NIK_suslov_the_revolution_renewed_desc:0 "After a long struggle, a truly socialist government has been restored, and we have begun marching once again towards the rising sun! Despite our difficult times, we have restored the people's faith in Lenin's heirs, and our party stands united by the secretary general's side.\n\nLenin set something beautiful in motion, more than fifty years ago. Now, it falls upon us to continue his legacy: the revolutionary spirit hasn't been crushed by the German panzers, and neither has it been blown apart by the Luftwaffe. Now, we renew our vows to the permanent revolution, to see its flame burn bright: workers of the world, forward!"

 NIK_suslov_revive_the_economy_desc:0 "After twenty years of civil strife and German bombings, the once powerful Soviet industrial machine has long since been relieved of its mortal worries. Abandoned factories litter what few cities can still pride themselves of such a name, their roofs collapsed under the bomb or due to neglect, their machineries broken beyond repairs.\n\nOur infrastructure too has been reduced to ashes, with roads, bridges and railroads interrupted by craters or floods, and our agricultural sector barely manages to feed our populace. Famine is a common issue for our beleaguered nation, and nothing will change if we can't at least keep our men and women from starving to death.\n\nStill, from difficulties come opportunities. With the German bombings gone, we have the chance, for the first time since the beginning of this nightmare, to better our condition: plans will be drafter, resources will be stored, and a new age of socialist industrialization will begin for the new Soviet Union! By the hammer and the sickle!"
 NIK_suslov_empower_the_gosplan_desc:0 "The Gosplan was founded by Bukharin as the economic planning board of the old Soviet Union. In the end, it wasn't used much due to his preference for light industry, and the results became evident during the war. While the agency has way less resources than our Motherland at the height of her power, we'll use our resources in a much more considerate manner.\n\nWe'll immediately assign enough personnel and funds to the agency so that it may begin drafting long-period plans for our economy, and devise short-term solutions for the issues currently plaguing our country. Our plans will reach much further than what we can achieve now, and we'll be prepared for anything that may come at us!"
 NIK_suslov_towards_the_next_phase_desc:0 "With our final goal being the establishment of a true communist regime, we need to set the first stones in our economy just as we are doing in politics. The state must oversee the entire economy, planning with precision and care the future needs of the country and the people, and ensure that production never exceeds demand, or vice versa.\n\nBy carefully balancing our resources for maximum industrial growth, and planning for the long term in case anything happens, we'll kick start both our economy and our advance towards true communism! The Soviet Union advances!"
 NIK_suslov_oversee_the_planning_desc:0 "The Gosplan has started working, and the resulting plans are satisfying to say the least. By further increasing their funds and personnel, we'll have both a tighter control over the economy, and more experts dedicated to the betterment of the Soviet people.\n\nAs our economy starts recovering, it is fundamental that we remain steady and do not fall prey to excesses. Even growing too much can be detrimental in the long run, and we must make sure that we do everything flawlessly."
 NIK_suslov_expand_central_production_nodes_desc:0 "Right now, our industries are located primarily around our few cities, with the capital being the most prominent. However, we'll need much more if we are to see our plans turned into reality: Gorky and the other industrial nodes must first be brought back into functioning order by repairing damaged or obsolete infrastructure, and bringing in modern machinery from wherever we can fetch it.\n\nOnce the preliminary work is done, we can start expanding them, interconnecting the region with modern railroads and building more industries, that will in turn give work to the masses of impoverished farmers coming from the countryside. Slowly but steadily, we'll increase our production capabilities, until we are poised to begin with the real economic struggle!"
 NIK_suslov_honor_the_peasants_desc:0 "One of the greatest mistakes of the Soviet Union was its excessive reliance on industrial cities. The people need to eat as much as they need in order to be both healthy and loyal, and in the larger scheme of things, a famine can be as much as a catastrophe as any military defeat.\n\nThe farmers are a fundamental part of any country, and especially a socialist one. No one will ever be allowed to think them "inferior" to industrial workers or to the bourgeois, and anyone daring to take their contribution for granted will be punished: an army marches on its stomach, and this is valid for countries too!"
 NIK_suslov_mechanize_the_kolkhozes_desc:0 "The Kolkhozes are collective farms organized by the state so that they can achieve maximum production efficiency. Until now, with our limited means this mainly meant that agricultural tools such as plows and scythes were shared between the farmers and that the workforce was assembled following centralized plans.\n\nWith our renewed focus on industrialization and economic growth, we shall finance a large agricultural mechanization plan for the Kolkhozes. Buying large stocks of farming machines such as tractors or threshing machines, we'll bring our agricultural sector out of the age of the tzars and into the modern age of socialism! Production will increase tenfolds, and farmers will be much happier as they no longer have to break their backs on the fields!"
 NIK_suslov_develop_refining_infrastructure_desc:0 "Oil refining is a complicated process that requires large investments. In the days of the old Soviet Union, the oil fields in the Caucasus covered our domestic needs, but we no longer have such a luxury: fuel is a rare and precious resource to obtain, and often the only way to get some is to pay black market dealers or rely on fickle peace treaties between several warlords.\n\nA modern industrial society can't survive without such a fundamental resource, and as such it is our duty to secure a stable and reliable source of the liquid gold. By funding the construction of refineries across our nation we'll make sure that our industries and mines have at least their basic needs satisfied until we can find some real oil."
 NIK_suslov_increase_resource_production_quotas_desc:0 "Our industrial sector is growing, which means our need for raw materials such as iron, coal, copper, wood, and many others is steadily increasing. With our mining sector already established, it will be difficult to find entirely new ore veins yet untapped, and we can't simply rely on luck.\n\nTo this end, we'll increase resource production quotas. By funding the acquisition of more modern machineries, improving mining crew training, and creating a new culture of stakhanovism, we'll maximize the output of our current mining facilities, reducing costs across the board: socialism is the way forward!"
 NIK_suslov_new_industrial_centers_desc:0 "Our main cities have developed nicely ever since we began our re-industrialization plan. However, relying too much on few large industrial nodes would make ourselves vulnerable: if twenty years of Luftwaffe bombings have taught us anything, diversifying production, and spreading out our industry, is the only way to keep going under duress.\n\nAs an additional benefit, funding the expansion and conversion of large agricultural towns into proper industrial cities will offer work to even more unemployed or poor people, and spread the ideals of socialism to the farthest reaches of our domain. From today, we start building the Soviet Union of tomorrow!"
 NIK_suslov_towards_a_stable_currency_desc:0 "While the final goal of socialism and communism is the eventual abolition of the currency, to be replaced with a just system where everyone gives what he can give to the state and receives what he needs from the community, we all know there's still a long way to go until we can even start to think about this. As such, we need to keep a currency, if only to trade with outside and to not impoverish the poor even more.\n\nThe Ruble of the Soviet Union has been kept as our official currency during these troubled times, but it has been devalued so much it no longer has any meaningful value: if we want a stable economy, we need to enact a comprehensive monetary reform to stabilize the currency and peg its value to fixed indexes decided by the state."
 NIK_suslov_the_road_to_recovery_desc:0 "To say that the Soviet Union has endured difficult times would be the secretary general of understatements. We have been subjected to twenty years of plundering, bombings, civil wars, famine, diseases, and every kind of disaster that could befall human civilization. If recovery was a road, it would be longer than the Trans-Siberian railroad!\n\nWith our efforts and our faith in socialism, however, we have finally turned the tables. While it will still take years - perhaps decades - to return to true prosperity, we have achieved admirable results in our quest for reconstruction: the people are no longer famished, and our industries are filled with hard-working crews proud of their role within society.\n\nOne day, we'll restore the Soviet Union to what it was before, just you wait!"
 NIK_suslov_the_soviet_education_system_desc:0 "One of the greatest changes the Soviet Union brought was free basic education for all. Under the Tzars, peasants weren't allowed to study in order to keep them forever under the nobles' thumb: with education comes innovation, and with innovation comes power!\n\nSadly, twenty years of civil strife and German bombings have destroyed the old education system in both a physical and metaphorical sense. With schools razed to the ground, and children forced to work to feed themselves and their families, learning has become a secondary, or even tertiary concerns.\n\nWe shall no longer tolerate such injustice! Our children need to learn so that they may improve both themselves and Mother Russia: we shall rebuild the old schools, and teach a new generation of young boys and girls the value of culture, and through it, how to be an outstanding Soviet citizen!"
 NIK_suslov_an_ideological_education_desc:0 "The traditional teaching methods and subjects are fine for elementary schools. Superior education, however - especially universities - needs to adapt to the new times, or we risk stagnation.\n\nBy introducing new study courses, and experimental curricula, we can revolutionize our education and help our students find what they excel at. Revolutionary minds produce revolutionary ideas, and the Soviet Union is the very embodiment of the concept of revolution!"
 NIK_suslov_expand_vocational_schools_desc:0 "Vocational schools teach young students with clear ideas about their future all about a single craft. While entrenched intellectuals consider them somewhat inferior to traditional universities, we are not as blind as them: from their classes come the next generations of artisans, engineers, farmers and bureaucrats, professions upon which lay the very foundation of a country!\n\nWe shall increase foundings to vocational schools, and give those brave boys and girls the best possible education. With it, they will be able to excel, and through it, they will elevate the Soviet Union to new heights of innovation and power: we all serve the nation, and we all deserve the best for it!"
 NIK_suslov_an_innovative_union_desc:0 "Gone are the days of decadence and backwardness. Gone are the fields tended by farmers and the factories where workers toiled with obsolete farmers. Gone are the child-workers and the empty classrooms. This is a new Russia, a new Union, where progress, for both the nation and the people, reigns supreme.\n\nWe have done so much, but we still have much more to do. The past is no longer stalking us, and now we are the ones chasing the future: new investments in science and education will send us barreling into a new era of progress!"

 NIK_suslov_restore_the_red_army_desc:0 "Our Red Army is still a relatively new institution. Formed in the chaos following the coup that brought Socialist rule to Komi, the current military force is only intended to be just good enough to carry out offensive operations without collapsing in on itself due to a lack of organization.\n\nUnfortunately, "good enough" simply won't cut it. The enemies of Socialism grow in strength all around us, and already pose a greater threat than any foe we faced during the unification wars. To better prepare ourselves for the inevitable wars of the future, The Red Army must be restored to its former glory; a professional fighting force that resembles the very same army that once stood on the frontlines against Fascist tyranny many years ago."
 NIK_suslov_lessons_from_the_second_patriotic_war_desc:0 "The Second Patriotic War, also known as the West Russian War, was the last and most recent conflict involving the united forces of Russia. The Red Army's mighty offensive very nearly broke the back of the Fascists, driving them from the A-A Line and putting their entire front on the verge of collapse. Yet, despite being on the very cusp of victory, military setbacks and traitors alike stole the victory right out of their hands.\n\nWe shall study the various tactics and strategies used by both sides. The Second Patriotic War was in many ways a herald of wars to come, with all parties involved utilizing never-before-seen methods of warfare. The overwhelming offensive launched by the Red Army in particular is worth studying, as well as the Fascists' miraculous recovery. "
 NIK_suslov_study_foreign_strategy_desc:0 "The world has not become any more peaceful since the period of stagnation that followed the Second Patriotic War, and already the great powers of the world throw their weight around in various proxy wars around the globe. These smaller-scale conflicts have already seen the use of all kinds of tactical innovation. In that case, perhaps it would be prudent to study the strategies used in these wars and find ways to adapt them for our own purposes?\n\nIn particular, the South African War has caught the interest of the Red Army's command staff. This bloody proxy conflict saw bold new concepts such as airmobile infantry and asymmetric warfare used by both sides, and served as a glimpse of what a true modern war could be. The lessons that were demonstrated in the hills and jungles of Africa could very well apply to the forests and tundra of Russia as well."
 NIK_suslov_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc:0 "West Russia is united under the red banner once more, but the road to get to this point was bloody indeed. The wars to bring the region under control saw some of the bloodiest fighting since the Second Patriotic War. Despite the Red Army's victory, the constant warfare exposed some serious flaws that will need to be addressed before we continue the reunification.\n\nEach warlord the Red Army crushed used different strategies and organized their forces in a unique fashion. We will take into account all the forces we encountered, and see if we can't incorporate their strengths into our own forces whilst avoiding their weaknesses."
 NIK_suslov_tactical_flexibility_desc:0 "It is often said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this was no more apparent than in the Unification Wars. Despite having detailed strategies in place for dealing with our enemies, more often than not unexpected developments would leave our command staff floundering and unable to react in time. All the while, our units on the field suffered while their officers panicked trying to determine what to do next.\n\nThese individual disasters could've been easily avoided had we implemented a more flexible system of unit tactics. More autonomy shall be given to the officers in the field, who will be trusted to improvise should the chain of command break down in the heat of battle. Instead of relying upon orders from on high, officers shall instead count on their own initiative, and the tactics utilized by individual units."
 NIK_suslov_a_modernized_force_desc:0 "Our efforts are paying off. The Red Army is beginning to closely resemble the very same force that crossed the A-A Line into Fascist-occupied territories nearly a decade ago, finally bearing the makings of a professional military. However, the truth is that we have not gone far enough. Our current Red Army would've been considered top notch in decades past, but is hardly up to modern standards.\n\nThe General Secretary has approved a massive increase in funding for the Red Army, intended to aid with more intensive modernization efforts. No longer shall we lag behind the rest of the world! Through the application of cutting-edge modern technologies and intuitive new tactics, the Red Army shall transform into a force ready to face the modern battlefield."
 NIK_suslov_the_kazan_military_academy_desc:0 "Kazan is home to one of nine "Suvorov Schools" that were created during the Bukharin era. These specialized boarding schools were intended to provide young men with a secondary, military-focused education, and as such, many of the Red Army's officers started their careers in these schools. Ever since the unfortunate collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the school in Kazan had gone mostly unused.\n\nWe shall renovate this building and reopen a new institution in its place: the Kazan Military Academy. Rather than being intended for secondary education, this new academy will be created with the express purpose of training new officers for the Red Army. Once Kazan's academy has been reestablished, we can begin creating the next generation of the Red Army's officer corps."
 NIK_suslov_doctrinal_refinement_desc:0 "The needs of a modern battlefield change at the blink of an eye, and if one is not careful they can find themselves falling behind the curve sooner than they'd think. Despite our best efforts, however, the doctrines in use by the Red Army are still hopelessly trapped in the past. If action is not taken soon, our enemies would surely run circles around us!\n\nThe time has come to analyze our strategies and refine them to be more suitable for a contemporary conflict. Not only must we bring the Red Army up to modern standards, but we must also keep a sharp eye towards the doctrines of the future. After all, working to maintain a clear advantage over our potential foes is paramount to achieving victory."
 NIK_suslov_the_revolutionary_soldier_desc:0 "At the end of the day, it is the rank-and-file who make up the beating heart of the Red Army. The soldiers of the Soviet Union were, at one time, legendary for both their devotion to the Socialist cause and their unflinching tenacity in battle. Our own troops are certainly not lacking in either of these aspects, and it would help to further encourage such professional ideals for the new recruits as well.\n\nThe ideal vision of a truly revolutionary soldier must be realized once again. We need able men and women who are willing to undertake any sacrifice necessary for the Motherland, soldiers who would make the Red Army worthy of proclaiming themselves as the strongest!"
 NIK_suslov_avtomat_kalashnikova_desc:0 "The AK-47 is a truly remarkable battle rifle. Capable of firing rifle-sized cartridges at 600 rounds per minute, the Kalashnikov has also gained a legendary reputation for reliability. The rifle can survive a tremendous level of punishment, and is able to survive in even the hardiest of conditions without encountering any sort of problems. On top of all of this, it is easy to maintain and relatively simple to manufacture.\n\nIt is said that you cannot improve perfection, but whoever coined that phrase has obviously never met a Russian weapons designer. We will begin trials on a new standard battle rifle for the Red Army, deriving from the tried-and-tested design of the AK-47. In time, our troops will hopefully get their hands on a weapon even more effective than the vaunted Kalashnikov."
 NIK_suslov_reorganize_the_war_ministry_desc:0 "With the expansion of our territory comes an unavoidable increase in the number of officers needed by the Red Army's general staff. This would not be too much of an issue if not for the fact that the War Ministry is currently a chaotic mess, virtually unchanged from the days of the Komi Republic. This sorry state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist. The War Ministry must be reorganized from the ground up to better serve the needs of a considerably larger area of operations.\n\nWith some extensive streamlining, it is believed that the chain of command will flow more smoothly. Generals will be able to receive any and all necessary information about combat readiness or battlefield conditions at a moments notice, enhancing their abilities to command our troops."
 NIK_suslov_the_new_northern_fleet_desc:0 "We were restricted to a landlocked status during the Komi Republic days, which meant there was little practical need for a naval force. The situation has changed dramatically, however. With access to the sea secured via the critical port of Arkhangelsk, the time has come to organize the beginnings of a new Red Fleet.\n\nWhile the port is frozen over during the winter, it is nonetheless the most important port west of the Urals that still remains in Russian hands. Our navy will be tasked with the protection of this port rather than large-scale naval actions against enemy fleets, as we do not have the capability nor need to build a large armada of ships."
 NIK_suslov_the_red_air_force_desc:0 "We still remember the dark months spent in the shadow of the Fascist terror bombing campaigns. Our only source of salvation was the brave exploits of the Free Aviators, but even they could not be everywhere at once. With the situation in West Russia stabilized for the time being, we must learn to stand on our own two feet in case the Luftwaffe returns to our skies.\n\nThe use of aircraft is nothing new to us, but without a proper military wing of their own, the potential of our wings is needlessly limited. Therefore, an independent air arm of the military, the Red Air Force, shall be created. To aid with the establishment of this new force, we shall expand key airbases under our control to house more aircraft, and begin development of modern aircraft to help dominate the sky."

 NIK_suslov_returning_to_the_world_desc:0 "The dark days of the warlord era have finally come to an end, and our young nation has climbed out from the abyss to establish itself as a true regional power. In the past, we have had little need for our foreign ministry, as diplomacy in the warlord period usually involved the sword rather than the pen.\n\nThe world beckons. We now find ourselves in need of capable diplomats now more than ever. The foreign ministry must be expanded to meet the requirements of properly conducting international diplomacy, and they shall begin making contact with the nations of the globe as soon as they are able. Let all of the foreign powers know that Socialism has returned to Russia in earnest!"
 NIK_suslov_restore_international_trade_desc:0 "The White Sea now lies open to us, and yet we still have no proper fleet to conduct international trade with. The nature of the arctic waters makes this task more difficult than it would seem. The port of Arkhangelsk is almost entirely frozen over during the winter months, and thus our merchant marine will require a specialized fleet of icebreakers to clear a path through to our trade partners.\n\nAccording to our foreign office, the nations of Scandinavia are already quite receptive to our offers of establishing trade. Due to their close proximity to our ports, they would be a relatively hassle-free journey for our merchant fleets as long as they are able to circumvent the frigid conditions of the White Sea."
 NIK_suslov_trans_polar_diplomacy_desc:0 "To the untrained eye, the frozen wastes of the Arctic seem like nothing more than an insurmountable obstacle to any kind of fleet, the ice providing an inconvenience for the port of Arkhangelsk in the winter months. While this is not entirely false, the truth is that these frigid waters are among the only remaining gateways into West Russia still controlled by Russians. As such, it would be prudent to foster good relations with the various nations of the north.\n\nWe shall extend an olive branch across the polar territories. Scandinavian countries such as Finland and Sweden are to receive requests for diplomatic recognition, while the very first overtures towards the nations of the OFN shall be sent to Iceland and Canada. No country is outside of our reach, even if they lie beyond the treacherous waters of the Arctic."
 NIK_suslov_contact_the_OFN_desc:0 "In most ordinary circumstances, the Organization of Free Nations would be our greatest adversary. The United States has long established itself the vanguard of predatory capitalism, staunchly opposed to the Socialist cause in every way imaginable. These are, however, not ordinary circumstances.\n\nThe black tides of Hitlerism have washed over Europe, leaving only a path of death and destruction. Even the Soviet Union was not spared from the aggression of the Fascists, and now our very heartland lies at their mercy. We will need allies if we are to overcome this threat, and the OFN are the only international alliance who share this goal. A message shall be sent to the OFN in good faith, requesting their diplomatic recognition. With luck, this agreement shall be the first step towards further cooperation, even if we are hesitant to work too closely with these capitalists."
 NIK_suslov_the_gateway_to_europe_desc:0 "Europe lies under a steel wall of Fascism, but there are many ways to pierce this barrier if one knows where to look. In particular, our neighbors in Finland provide a convenient avenue for this purpose. Relations have not exactly been warm due to past tensions, but perhaps it is still possible to reach common ground.\n\nWe will send a message to the Finns with a few polite requests. Firstly, we will ask for diplomatic recognition to further cement ourselves as the legitimate Russian government. Secondly, access to their ports will be requested. Although we control ports of our own, the fact remains that they are frozen over in the winter months, and have no access to the Baltic whatsoever. Land access to Finland's territories would solve this issue quite handily."
 NIK_suslov_the_swedish_diplomatic_mission_desc:0 "Sweden is one of the few European nations that has yet to fall under the sinister influence of Nazism, retaining its status as fully independent democracy. Their neutrality during the Second World War may have been seen by some as cowardice, but in the end it meant the complete preservation of their sovereignty.\n\nDiplomacy with the Swedes is paramount to our goals of establishing international relations, especially when one considers their proximity. A fully fledged diplomatic delegation is to be sent to Stockholm, with the goal of requesting their diplomatic recognition. Should they accept, we will be one step closer to establishing our government as a legitimate entity."
 NIK_suslov_approach_free_norway_desc:0 "It would appear that the iron grip that Nazi Germany has over Europe is not nearly as tight as it seems. Norway was once ruled by an oppressive Nazi colonial government, their freedom cruelly denied by the Germans in their quest for total domination over their neighbors. Miraculously, the situation has made a dramatic reversal.\n\nThe Norwegians have finally thrown off their shackles and removed the Nazi regime from power, establishing an independent government in its place. They are now surrounded on nearly all sides by Fascist influence, and will need all the help they can get. We shall send a delegation to Free Norway offering military assistance in exchange for recognizing our government as the legitimate successor to the Soviet Union."
 NIK_suslov_an_english_embassy_desc:0 "Even the proud English people were not spared from the advance of Nazi Germany, and following the Second World War a German-aligned government was imposed upon them. Luckily, it was not to last. The English have overthrown this illegitimate puppet regime and restored an independent state in bold defiance of the Fascists.\n\nTheir struggle is not over however, and many international observers have considered the possibility that the Germans may soon retaliate to reestablish dominion over England. Should this happen, we shall stand with them in the form of military aid. If they recognize our government, we will begin to send them as many weapons and munitions as we can spare."
 NIK_suslov_open_the_rykov_conference_desc:0 "The Soviet Union was once the bulwark of the global Socialist cause, sponsoring their comrades from around the world no matter where they came from. Ever since the collapse, however, this mantle has gone unclaimed for nearly two decades. With a Socialist government restored to West Russia, we must regain the initiative.\n\nThe idea has been floated of holding a conference in Rykov in the interest of fostering relations with Socialist parties from across the globe and reaffirming our commitment to the international worker. Representatives from hundreds of countries would be invited to attend, and discuss how to proceed with advancing our mutual goals. This conference will hopefully reestablish our government as the preeminent Socialist power and a friend to the workers of the world."
 NIK_suslov_propose_the_socintern_desc:0 "The Rykov Conference was a good first step to reestablishing solidarity with fellow Socialists from around the world, but we can go even farther. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist International that it had established had fallen into irrelevance, and eventually became defunct altogether. We must rekindle this flame, and create a new entity for encouraging global cooperation.\n\nA new Socialist International has been proposed. Like the ComIntern that came before it, the SocIntern will enable more effective economic and political cooperation between all the socialist parties of the world. Even in these dark times, the SocIntern shall ensure that the revolution will prevail no matter what trials lie ahead. Solidarity forever!"

 NIK_bukharina_a_triumph_for_the_soviets_desc:0 "At last, socialism has reigned supreme in Russia and in the way the Soviets intended. However, we must ensure that the regime does not become a vast, endless bureaucracy of Communist Party officials all governing thanks to fear of the leader striking down upon them.\n\nWith its reunification, West Russia provides an excellent opportunity to experiment and prove the effectiveness of true council communism. The workers' councils, the original soviets, will be restored to their positions of power, and they will be the ones to make decisions through a reformed system of government. No one is denying that this won't be an easy task, but this is why the General Secretary has assembled a team of the best people ready to get down to work and restore true socialism."
 NIK_bukharina_assemble_the_presidium_desc:0 "To give power to the workers, a system of a bicameral legislature has been conceived by General Secretary Bukharina. The Congress of Soviets will be a large body for which hundreds of soviet representatives, hard workers from all across free Russia, are elected. They, in turn, vote on the members of the Presidium, the upper house as westerners would call it. Presidium members are to be carefully proposed by the General Secretary herself, as they will need to be capable of fulfilling their role as her chief advisors and planners.\n\nThere are many possible candidates for Presidium members - others are officials from the old Union prepared to serve it once again, while others are young, rising stars with great ambitions. Only the best will be chosen, and they will be assigned with tasks important if we are to reach our former glory."
 NIK_bukharina_soviet_humanism_desc:0 "It is no secret that the USSR of old was ... not exactly a champion of human rights. General Secretary Bukharina recognizes this, and knows of the events that took place in the interwar period in Russia. However, it will be the goal of the new regime to change the public perception of itself, from an allegedly totalitarian state to one of equality and opportunity.\n\nIn the age of communication, it has never been easier to spread a message through radio and on television. The government will use that to its advantage, and reaffirm to its people and to the world that it is dedicated to the principles of humanism, and to an egalitarian society different from the failed Union. Once we have done that, we can begin to make sure it becomes the reality on the ground, and a new era for the nation will be ushered in."
 NIK_bukharina_a_free_woman_desc:0 "The fact that a woman is the leader of the state is already a testament to the equal opportunities presented by the new Union, but it is not quite enough. As per the General Secretary's wish, steps will be taken in the direction of gender equality within the framework of the socialist state. To begin with, a committee will be formed of special advisors from both genders on Comrade Bukharina's orders, and its purpose will be none other than to support social equality and solve any disputes in that regard. From there, it will be a process of gradually getting laws and amendments passed, so that women may finally be free and equal to men in the workplace, at home, and in society as a whole."
 NIK_bukharina_a_free_worker_desc:0 "The goal of a communist state is, above all, to guarantee the freedom and the power of the common worker. The government understands this, and will immediately begin taking progressive measures with said goal in mind. Primitive laws on workers' rights already exist, but they are often not optimal or are not followed in certain areas. These laws will be reformed and codified as per the wishes of the Congress and the Presidium, while those who do not follow them are to be punished accordingly. In addition, the changes will be publicized through media, so that everyone learns of the leaps the new Union has made."
 NIK_bukharina_return_to_kollontai_desc:0 "Alexandra Kollontai, as one of the few female Old Bolsheviks, is considered an early champion of women's rights and for good reason. She spearheaded the idea of Marxist feminism, the idea that true gender equality in all aspects can only be achieved as a result of a socialist revolution like the one the Bolsheviks planned and eventually executed.\n\nWhile that may not have been completely achieved, it is now Comrade Bukharina's will and our duty to continue Kollontai's legacy. Her ideology will not only be accepted, but we shall bake it into law as a not insignificant part of the new Union's ideology and policy. Therefore, we will assure Russia is entrenched as a champion of equality and one of the first nations to truly confront the matter."
 NIK_bukharina_a_culture_of_questioning_desc:0 "The Russians and other ethnicities inside our borders are often defined by century-old traditions and moral codes. However, what do they matter if all they do is hold us back and prevent progress comparable to the rest of the world? Lenin and Bukharin started launched the idea of questioning these long-lasting traditions as they occasionally proved to be hurdles in the development of society, but never finished it. The warlord era was another blow to these new ideas, but we are here to fix that.\n\nThe General Secretary and the Presidium have agreed on a course of action through which the state will encourage rethinking these ancient cultural trends. An abundance of speeches and propaganda will help to achieve much-needed progress."
 NIK_bukharina_empower_the_councils_desc:0 "As the next step in giving the workers more power over their jobs, the local soviets across the country will be trusted with a certain level of control and self-autonomy. They will be allowed to set forth their own candidates for representation, as well as be the ones who decide quotas for production and several other measures that deal with their own workplace.\n\nOf course, the Presidium understands that no group can be completely trustworthy when they have control, and for that reason the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation will be useful. As the service to ensure everything runs smoothly, they will be observing the different factories and councils, seeking any dishonest men and women who would dare lie about their reports and work."
 NIK_bukharina_open_the_government_desc:0 "In order to ensure a truly free society, the government must be transparent and open with the people. In order to raise the people's confidence in our state apparatus, we shall open certain archives for public viewing, and pass an order to declassify certain documents after a statute of limitations has passed. Whilst the security apparatus is important, and some things must remained buried, to be open and honest about the People's government is a paramount task."
 NIK_bukharina_for_your_own_good_desc:0 "A free society is important, but the government cannot always be liberal with its recordkeeping. If the security of the state is compromised, even for ostensibly pure reasons, then all will be in danger. As such, we cannot make government records public. This is especially true for information pertaining to state security. It may not be popular, but the people will understand that it is for their own good."
 NIK_bukharina_declare_an_extraordinary_session_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of resurgent Russia to combat any remaining counter-revolutionary movements, some cells and underground groups still linger and remind us of the days of the Komi Republic's turbulent politics. Suslovite and Zhdanovite supporters continue to exist both among the citizens of the country and in some cases inside the government, perhaps plotting to overthrow it.\n\nThis cannot stand. The Presidium, responsible for governing the country, and the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation, responsible for keeping it safe, will convene as soon as possible to discuss solutions to this urgent matter. Under the supervision of the General Secretary, their task for the near future will be to eliminate the last threats to the state, so that we can move forward."
 NIK_bukharina_a_loyal_police_force_desc:0 "Our past of cooperation with Suslovite and Zhdanovite elements still haunts us, as they have contacts in important positions even to this day. For example, the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation - a body meant to serve the government and protect its people - has possibly been infiltrated by these revisionists, and must now be reformed.\n\nTrusted men and women, who have stood on the side of the General Secretary since the early days, will be put in charge of the operation to identify and purge any possible dissidents and agents. Anyone deemed disloyal inside the URS will be discharged, and if their treason to the state is proven, tried for their crimes. Only through a clean police force will the revolution be able to survive and expand."
 NIK_bukharina_blind_the_ultravisionaries_desc:0 "The strange and esoteric ideas of the Ultravisionaries are, ultimately, dangerous to the welfare and security of the state. It is clear that Zhdanov's faction must be dealt with. Known members will be expelled from government office, their leaders will be discredited in the court of public opinion, and they will be watched carefully for the rest of their lives. This bizarre cult will be excised, as cleanly and decisively as possible."
 NIK_bukharina_shackle_the_dogmatists_desc:0 "Mikhail Suslov's hardline faction has been sidelined, and Suslov himself removed from the equation entirely. However, we still need to deal with many of its members who remain in public office. They need not be purged as thoroughly as Zhdanov's people, but we still must remove them from positions of power. A few retirements here, and a few reassignments there. The old dogmatists must not be able to threaten our efforts."
 NIK_bukharina_peace_at_last_desc:0 "At last, our position in the government is secure. The esotericists and hardliners have been removed from power, and any threat that they would pose to us has been effectively neutralized. We still need to ensure that those in government who have voiced concerns are properly dealt with, but after some stern messaging, they should get the picture. Our republic has been united under the left, and we may move towards a better future for all."
 NIK_bukharina_the_march_to_utopia_desc:0 "With our republic's new government united and strong, we can begin the march towards the utopia of the future. We will create a society of total social equality, justice for all, unity among all the working peoples of the world, and where true Communism has been finally achieved, once and for all. The workers of our republic will control their destinies, our scientists will design a new future for humanity, our farmers and agronomists will feed a hungry world, and our brave soldiers will defend the people's revolution, come what may. What began in the salons of Switzerland and the backrooms of Syktyvkar will reach the hearts and minds of all humanity. Utopia is on the horizon, and we will reach it!"
 
 NIK_bukharina_an_economy_of_the_people_desc:0 "The fall of the USSR during the First Patriotic War was, among many other things, caused by the flaws in its economic system. While our predecessors surely tried their best at organizing a socialist economy, in the end they failed due to both technological and ideological limitations.\n\nIf we are to rebuild Russia, we need to create a functional economy, where the citizen receives from the state what he or she needs, and gives in return his loyalty and his work. With such reforms, we'll be one step ahead of our competitors, and we'll create a country both powerful and fair!"
 NIK_bukharina_learning_from_the_past_desc:0 "Despite his faults - and ultimate failure - Bukharin had great ideas and great plans for the Soviet Union. While we intend to surpass him, it would be foolish to simply discard all his work: instead, we'll learn from his reforms, and salvage what good he did so that he may serve the Motherland even after his passing.\n\nBy studying his Siberian Development Plan, focusing on infrastructural innovations and subsidizing light industry, we'll be able to boost our economy and dramatically increase our industrial base, which will greatly benefit both the people and the country as a whole."
 NIK_bukharina_a_union_of_workers_desc:0 "Rather than the German-held industries, where slaves toil and die in both cruel and inefficient ways, we aim to free the worker by granting him not only a fair salary, but the knowledge he needs to improve both his standing and his productivity.\n\nIf we instruct our factory crews on the latest advancements in industrial production methods, we'll create a loyal and skilled workforce, and make a great leap forward in our quest to save Mother Russia!"
 NIK_bukharina_and_a_union_of_peasants_desc:0 "One of the greatest mistakes of the Soviet Union was its excessive reliance on industrial cities. The people need to eat as much as they need in order to be both healthy and loyal, and in the larger scheme of things, a famine can be as much as a catastrophe as any military defeat.\n\nBy providing our farmers with modern machinery subsidized by the state, and teaching them how to properly use and maintain them, agricultural output will increase tenfolds. An army marches on its stomach, and this is valid for countries too!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_special_developmental_commission_desc:0 "Russia is vast, and there are large swathes of land full of yet untapped potential. Natural resources waiting to be exploited, fertile land abandoned, and broken infrastructure can be found all across the Motherland, and even within the part that we control.\n\nBy establishing a commission tasked with the individuation and development of such areas is of paramount importance if we are to establish ourselves as serious contenders for the unification of Russia: failure won't be tolerated, nor forgiven!"
 NIK_bukharina_urban_industrial_development_desc:0 "Our cities have been hit hard by the fall of the Soviet Union and the subsequent German bombings. Thousands of people live in huts as their homes have been destroyed, and damaged power lines and industrial machinery jeopardize our production efforts.\n\nWithout industry, there is no Soviet Union, which means that we have to restore our cities and industrial hubs to their former glory. Repairing urban areas, restoring electric power and kickstarting our industry will slowly but surely bring us back into shape, and the people will surely appreciate it."
 NIK_bukharina_integrate_regional_infrastructure_desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, many warlords and disloyal officers have claimed pieces of Russia as their own. Throughout the years, roads, railroads and power lines were disrupted, repaired, sabotaged, rebuilt and destroyed again by a variety of different actors: as a result, emergency repairs and lack of standardization plague our country and cripple our economy.\n\nBy instituting a new and uniform set of standards - especially in rail gauge - we'll be able to slowly integrate the infrastructures scattered across Komi, and it will be a starting point for our future endeavors should we be able to expand and reclaim the lost lands of the Soviet Union."
 NIK_bukharina_rural_agricultural_development_desc:0 "Now that we have set the basis by teaching our farmers about the modern agricultural production methods, we can bring this a step forward by establishing a concerted development effort for our farmlands.\n\nBy subsidizing larger infrastructures such as aqueducts and irrigation channels, that individual farmers would never be able to affort, we can not only increase our agricultural output, but also foster a sense of gratitude among those who will benefit from our efforts. We serve Mother Russia through its people!"
 NIK_bukharina_resource_extraction_initiatives_desc:0 "With our preliminary investments completed, we can now start a serious resource extraction program. Newer infrastructure and improved working methods are a nice start, but in the end they can't change the situation on their own: the state needs to intervene with more subsidies.\n\nBy granting our mines with state funds to buy the latest extraction machines, and directly linking our railroad system to each production facility, we'll increase efficiency across the board, speeding up extraction and cutting the costs. We need everything we can get to save Russia!"
 NIK_bukharina_industrial_farming_methods_desc:0 "We have already done much for our agricultural sector, but we can do even more. Our Motherland is cold in weather, but warm in maternal instinct: if we want to truly rebuild Russia, we must care for everyone, and providing food is the first and essential step.\n\nTo this end, we shall increase investments into farming machinery, build even more advanced and dedicated infrastructure, and employ the latest technologies in seed selection and intensive farming. By our effort, we shall turn every corner of our land into verdant fields!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_ideal_synthesis_desc:0 "Finally, our efforts are bringing results. Industrial and agricultural production have increased by several orders of magnitude, and the people thank us for their newly-found prosperity: our lands have been healed from the scars inflicted by war, and we have recovered from our backward methods.\n\nHowever, this isn't enough.\n\nThe Soviet Union we desire does not follow, it leads! We can't be satisfied with copying what others invented, therefore we shall return to the forefront of innovation: our scientists and engineers will work without rest to discover newer and more advanced production methods, so that we may forever be one step aheads of our rivals, both inside and outside Russia!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_soviet_education_system_desc:0 "One of the greatest changes the Soviet Union brought was free basic education for all. Under the Tzars, peasants weren't allowed to study in order to keep them forever under the nobles' thumb: with education comes innovation, and with innovation comes power!\n\nSadly, twenty years of civil strife and German bombings have destroyed the old education system in both a physical and metaphorical sense. With schools razed to the ground, and children forced to work to feed themselves and their families, learning has become a secondary, or even tertiary concerns.\n\nWe shall no longer tolerate such injustice! Our children need to learn so that they may improve both themselves and Mother Russia: we shall rebuild the old schools, and teach a new generation of young boys and girls the value of culture, and through it, how to be an outstanding Soviet citizen!"
 NIK_bukharina_experimental_curricula_desc:0 "The traditional teaching methods and subjects are fine for elementary schools. Superior education, however - especially universities - needs to adapt to the new times, or we risk stagnation.\n\nBy introducing new study courses, and experimental curricula, we can revolutionize our education and help our students find what they excel at. Revolutionary minds produce revolutionary ideas, and the Soviet Union is the very embodiment of the concept of revolution!"
 NIK_bukharina_expand_vocational_schools_desc:0 "Vocational schools teach young students with clear ideas about their future all about a single craft. While entrenched intellectuals consider them somewhat inferior to traditional universities, we are not as blind as them: from their classes come the next generations of artisans, engineers, farmers and bureaucrats, professions upon which lay the very foundation of a country!\n\nWe shall increase foundings to vocational schools, and give those brave boys and girls the best possible education. With it, they will be able to excel, and through it, they will elevate the Soviet Union to new heights of innovation and power: we all serve the Union, and we all deserve the best for it!"
 NIK_bukharina_an_innovative_union_desc:0 "Gone are the days of decadence and backwardness. Gone are the fields tended by farmers and the factories where workers toiled with obsolete farmers. Gone are the child-workers and the empty classrooms. This is a new Russia, a new Union, where progress, for both the nation and the people, reigns supreme.\n\nWe have done so much, but we still have much more to do. The past is no longer stalking us, and now we are the ones chasing the future: new investments in science and education will send us barreling into a new era of progress!"

 NIK_bukharina_restore_the_red_army_desc:0 "Our Red Army is still a relatively new institution. Formed in the chaos following the coup that brought Socialist rule to Komi, the current military force is only intended to be just good enough to carry out offensive operations without collapsing in on itself due to a lack of organization.\n\nUnfortunately, "good enough" simply won't cut it. The enemies of Socialism grow in strength all around us, and already pose a greater threat than any foe we faced during the unification wars. To better prepare ourselves for the inevitable wars of the future, The Red Army must be restored to its former glory; a professional fighting force that resembles the very same army that once stood on the frontlines against Fascist tyranny many years ago."
 NIK_bukharina_lessons_from_the_second_patriotic_war_desc:0 "The Second Patriotic War, also known as the West Russian War, was the last and most recent conflict involving the united forces of Russia. The Red Army's mighty offensive very nearly broke the back of the Fascists, driving them from the A-A Line and putting their entire front on the verge of collapse. Yet, despite being on the very cusp of victory, military setbacks and traitors alike stole the victory right out of their hands.\n\nWe shall study the various tactics and strategies used by both sides. The Second Patriotic War was in many ways a herald of wars to come, with all parties involved utilizing never-before-seen methods of warfare. The overwhelming offensive launched by the Red Army in particular is worth studying, as well as the Fascists' miraculous recovery."
 NIK_bukharina_study_foreign_strategy_desc:0 "The world has not become any more peaceful since the period of stagnation that followed the Second Patriotic War, and already the great powers of the world throw their weight around in various proxy wars around the globe. These smaller-scale conflicts have already seen the use of all kinds of tactical innovation. In that case, perhaps it would be prudent to study the strategies used in these wars and find ways to adapt them for our own purposes?\n\nIn particular, the South African War has caught the interest of the Red Army's command staff. This bloody proxy conflict saw bold new concepts such as airmobile infantry and asymmetric warfare used by both sides, and served as a glimpse of what a true modern war could be. The lessons that were demonstrated in the hills and jungles of Africa could very well apply to the forests and tundra of Russia as well."
 NIK_bukharina_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc:0 "West Russia is united under the red banner once more, but the road to get to this point was bloody indeed. The wars to bring the region under control saw some of the bloodiest fighting since the Second Patriotic War. Despite the Red Army's victory, the constant warfare exposed some serious flaws that will need to be addressed before we continue the reunification.\n\nEach warlord the Red Army crushed used different strategies and organized their forces in a unique fashion. We will take into account all the forces we encountered, and see if we can't incorporate their strengths into our own forces whilst avoiding their weaknesses."
 NIK_bukharina_tactical_flexibility_desc:0 "It is often said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this was no more apparent than in the Unification Wars. Despite having detailed strategies in place for dealing with our enemies, more often than not unexpected developments would leave our command staff floundering and unable to react in time. All the while, our units on the field suffered while their officers panicked trying to determine what to do next.\n\nThese individual disasters could've been easily avoided had we implemented a more flexible system of unit tactics. More autonomy shall be given to the officers in the field, who will be trusted to improvise should the chain of command break down in the heat of battle. Instead of relying upon orders from on high, officers shall instead count on their own initiative, and the tactics utilized by individual units."
 NIK_bukharina_a_modernized_force_desc:0 "Our efforts are paying off. The Red Army is beginning to closely resemble the very same force that crossed the A-A Line into Fascist-occupied territories nearly a decade ago, finally bearing the makings of a professional military. However, the truth is that we have not gone far enough. Our current Red Army would've been considered top notch in decades past, but is hardly up to modern standards.\n\nThe General Secretary has approved a massive increase in funding for the Red Army, intended to aid with more intensive modernization efforts. No longer shall we lag behind the rest of the world! Through the application of cutting-edge modern technologies and intuitive new tactics, the Red Army shall transform into a force ready to face the modern battlefield."
 NIK_bukharina_the_kazan_military_academy_desc:0 "Kazan is home to one of nine "Suvorov Schools" that were created during the Bukharin era. These specialized boarding schools were intended to provide young men with a secondary, military-focused education, and as such, many of the Red Army's officers started their careers in these schools. Ever since the unfortunate collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the school in Kazan had gone mostly unused.\n\nWe shall renovate this building and reopen a new institution in its place: the Kazan Military Academy. Rather than being intended for secondary education, this new academy will be created with the express purpose of training new officers for the Red Army. Once Kazan's academy has been reestablished, we can begin creating the next generation of the Red Army's officer corps."
 NIK_bukharina_doctrinal_refinement_desc:0 "The needs of a modern battlefield change at the blink of an eye, and if one is not careful they can find themselves falling behind the curve sooner than they'd think. Despite our best efforts, however, the doctrines in use by the Red Army are still hopelessly trapped in the past. If action is not taken soon, our enemies would surely run circles around us!\n\nThe time has come to analyze our strategies and refine them to be more suitable for a contemporary conflict. Not only must we bring the Red Army up to modern standards, but we must also keep a sharp eye towards the doctrines of the future. After all, working to maintain a clear advantage over our potential foes is paramount to achieving victory."
 NIK_bukharina_the_revolutionary_soldier_desc:0 "At the end of the day, it is the rank-and-file who make up the beating heart of the Red Army. The soldiers of the Soviet Union were, at one time, legendary for both their devotion to the Socialist cause and their unflinching tenacity in battle. Our own troops are certainly not lacking in either of these aspects, and it would help to further encourage such professional ideals for the new recruits as well.\n\nThe ideal vision of a truly revolutionary soldier must be realized once again. We need able men and women who are willing to undertake any sacrifice necessary for the Motherland, soldiers who would make the Red Army worthy of proclaiming themselves as the strongest!"
 NIK_bukharina_avtomat_kalashnikova_desc:0 "The AK-47 is a truly remarkable battle rifle. Capable of firing rifle-sized cartridges at 600 rounds per minute, the Kalashnikov has also gained a legendary reputation for reliability. The rifle can survive a tremendous level of punishment, and is able to survive in even the hardiest of conditions without encountering any sort of problems. On top of all of this, it is easy to maintain and relatively simple to manufacture.\n\nIt is said that you cannot improve perfection, but whoever coined that phrase has obviously never met a Russian weapons designer. We will begin trials on a new standard battle rifle for the Red Army, deriving from the tried-and-tested design of the AK-47. In time, our troops will hopefully get their hands on a weapon even more effective than the vaunted Kalashnikov."
 NIK_bukharina_reorganize_the_war_ministry_desc:0 "With the expansion of our territory comes an unavoidable increase in the number of officers needed by the Red Army's general staff. This would not be too much of an issue if not for the fact that the War Ministry is currently a chaotic mess, virtually unchanged from the days of the Komi Republic. This sorry state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist. The War Ministry must be reorganized from the ground up to better serve the needs of a considerably larger area of operations.\n\nWith some extensive streamlining, it is believed that the chain of command will flow more smoothly. Generals will be able to receive any and all necessary information about combat readiness or battlefield conditions at a moments notice, enhancing their abilities to command our troops."
 NIK_bukharina_the_new_northern_fleet_desc:0 "We were restricted to a landlocked status during the Komi Republic days, which meant there was little practical need for a naval force. The situation has changed dramatically, however. With access to the sea secured via the critical port of Arkhangelsk, the time has come to organize the beginnings of a new Red Fleet.\n\nWhile the port is frozen over during the winter, it is nonetheless the most important port west of the Urals that still remains in Russian hands. Our navy will be tasked with the protection of this port rather than large-scale naval actions against enemy fleets, as we do not have the capability nor need to build a large armada of ships."
 NIK_bukharina_the_red_air_force_desc:0 "We still remember the dark months spent in the shadow of the Fascist terror bombing campaigns. Our only source of salvation was the brave exploits of the Free Aviators, but even they could not be everywhere at once. With the situation in West Russia stabilized for the time being, we must learn to stand on our own two feet in case the Luftwaffe returns to our skies.\n\nThe use of aircraft is nothing new to us, but without a proper military wing of their own, the potential of our wings is needlessly limited. Therefore, an independent air arm of the military, the Red Air Force, shall be created. To aid with the establishment of this new force, we shall expand key airbases under our control to house more aircraft, and begin development of modern aircraft to help dominate the sky."

 NIK_bukharina_returning_to_the_world_desc:0 "The dark days of the warlord era have finally come to an end, and our young nation has climbed out from the abyss to establish itself as a true regional power. In the past, we have had little need for our foreign ministry, as diplomacy in the warlord period usually involved the sword rather than the pen.\n\nThe world beckons. We now find ourselves in need of capable diplomats now more than ever. The foreign ministry must be expanded to meet the requirements of properly conducting international diplomacy, and they shall begin making contact with the nations of the globe as soon as they are able. Let all of the foreign powers know that Socialism has returned to Russia in earnest!"
 NIK_bukharina_restore_international_trade_desc:0 "The White Sea now lies open to us, and yet we still have no proper fleet to conduct international trade with. The nature of the arctic waters makes this task more difficult than it would seem. The port of Arkhangelsk is almost entirely frozen over during the winter months, and thus our merchant marine will require a specialized fleet of icebreakers to clear a path through to our trade partners.\n\nAccording to our foreign office, the nations of Scandinavia are already quite receptive to our offers of establishing trade. Due to their close proximity to our ports, they would be a relatively hassle-free journey for our merchant fleets as long as they are able to circumvent the frigid conditions of the White Sea."
 NIK_bukharina_trans_polar_diplomacy_desc:0 "To the untrained eye, the frozen wastes of the Arctic seem like nothing more than an insurmountable obstacle to any kind of fleet, the ice providing an inconvenience for the port of Arkhangelsk in the winter months. While this is not entirely false, the truth is that these frigid waters are among the only remaining gateways into West Russia still controlled by Russians. As such, it would be prudent to foster good relations with the various nations of the north.\n\nWe shall extend an olive branch across the polar territories. Scandinavian countries such as Finland and Sweden are to receive requests for diplomatic recognition, while the very first overtures towards the nations of the OFN shall be sent to Iceland and Canada. No country is outside of our reach, even if they lie beyond the treacherous waters of the Arctic."
 NIK_bukharina_contact_the_OFN_desc:0 "In most ordinary circumstances, the Organization of Free Nations would be our greatest adversary. The United States has long established itself the vanguard of predatory capitalism, staunchly opposed to the Socialist cause in every way imaginable. These are, however, not ordinary circumstances.\n\nThe black tides of Hitlerism have washed over Europe, leaving only a path of death and destruction. Even the Soviet Union was not spared from the aggression of the Fascists, and now our very heartland lies at their mercy. We will need allies if we are to overcome this threat, and the OFN are the only international alliance who share this goal. A message shall be sent to the OFN in good faith, requesting their diplomatic recognition. With luck, this agreement shall be the first step towards further cooperation, even if we are hesitant to work too closely with these capitalists."
 NIK_bukharina_the_gateway_to_europe_desc:0 "Europe lies under a steel wall of Fascism, but there are many ways to pierce this barrier if one knows where to look. In particular, our neighbors in Finland provide a convenient avenue for this purpose. Relations have not exactly been warm due to past tensions, but perhaps it is still possible to reach common ground.\n\nWe will send a message to the Finns with a few polite requests. Firstly, we will ask for diplomatic recognition to further cement ourselves as the legitimate Russian government. Secondly, access to their ports will be requested. Although we control ports of our own, the fact remains that they are frozen over in the winter months, and have no access to the Baltic whatsoever. Land access to Finland's territories would solve this issue quite handily."
 NIK_bukharina_the_swedish_diplomatic_mission_desc:0 "Sweden is one of the few European nations that has yet to fall under the sinister influence of Nazism, retaining its status as fully independent democracy. Their neutrality during the Second World War may have been seen by some as cowardice, but in the end it meant the complete preservation of their sovereignty.\n\nDiplomacy with the Swedes is paramount to our goals of establishing international relations, especially when one considers their proximity. A fully fledged diplomatic delegation is to be sent to Stockholm, with the goal of requesting their diplomatic recognition. Should they accept, we will be one step closer to establishing our government as a legitimate entity."
 NIK_bukharina_approach_free_norway_desc:0 "It would appear that the iron grip that Nazi Germany has over Europe is not nearly as tight as it seems. Norway was once ruled by an oppressive Nazi colonial government, their freedom cruelly denied by the Germans in their quest for total domination over their neighbors. Miraculously, the situation has made a dramatic reversal.\n\nThe Norwegians have finally thrown off their shackles and removed the Nazi regime from power, establishing an independent government in its place. They are now surrounded on nearly all sides by Fascist influence, and will need all the help they can get. We shall send a delegation to Free Norway offering military assistance in exchange for recognizing our government as the legitimate successor to the Soviet Union."
 NIK_bukharina_an_english_embassy_desc:0 "Even the proud English people were not spared from the advance of Nazi Germany, and following the Second World War a German-aligned government was imposed upon them. Luckily, it was not to last. The English have overthrown this illegitimate puppet regime and restored an independent state in bold defiance of the Fascists.\n\nTheir struggle is not over however, and many international observers have considered the possibility that the Germans may soon retaliate to reestablish dominion over England. Should this happen, we shall stand with them in the form of military aid. If they recognize our government, we will begin to send them as many weapons and munitions as we can spare."
 NIK_bukharina_open_the_rykov_conference_desc:0 "The Soviet Union was once the bulwark of the global Socialist cause, sponsoring their comrades from around the world no matter where they came from. Ever since the collapse, however, this mantle has gone unclaimed for nearly two decades. With a Socialist government restored to West Russia, we must regain the initiative.\n\nThe idea has been floated of holding a conference in Rykov in the interest of fostering relations with Socialist parties from across the globe and reaffirming our commitment to the international worker. Representatives from hundreds of countries would be invited to attend, and discuss how to proceed with advancing our mutual goals. This conference will hopefully reestablish our government as the preeminent Socialist power and a friend to the workers of the world."
 NIK_bukharina_propose_the_socintern_desc:0 "The Rykov Conference was a good first step to reestablishing solidarity with fellow Socialists from around the world, but we can go even farther. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist International that it had established had fallen into irrelevance, and eventually became defunct altogether. We must rekindle this flame, and create a new entity for encouraging global cooperation.\n\nA new Socialist International has been proposed. Like the ComIntern that came before it, the SocIntern will enable more effective economic and political cooperation between all the socialist parties of the world. Even in these dark times, the SocIntern shall ensure that the revolution will prevail no matter what trials lie ahead. Solidarity forever!"

 NIK_bukharina_the_path_to_liberation_desc:0 "Despite the odds, we have managed to liberate West Russia and West Siberia! Our people cheer in the streets, for they know that freedom and prosperity is at hand. While we will undoubtedly have to work to ensure that West Siberia is fully integrated into our government, it seems that the sun shines on Bukharina's ideals. We must not falter now, for we must continue onwards towards utopia!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_triumphant_reforms_desc:0 "While we were able to enact some reforms after the unification of West Russia, there was still much doubt about Bukharina as a leader that prevented her from enacting the full breadth of her plans. With the successful reclamation of West Siberia, many of the doubts about Bukharina have been swept away, allowing her to push onwards. The time has come to begin enacting further reforms to push the people closer into a truly socialist society. These reforms will include ensuring equality for all, investigating the necessity of the familial unit, and ensuring that traditionalism's influence in society is greatly weakened. We shall ensure that the Soviet Union is a utopia for all!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_value_of_equality_desc:0 "Any socialist will talk about equality. Question them, and they shall go on about the equality of man to woman, of Russian to Indian, and so on. However, what is much rarer is the socialist that backs up said values with actions. All too common is the socialist who will state their belief in gender equality, just to turn around and deprive women of their rights. We must break this cycle by not only espousing the values of equality, but by supporting those who have been wronged by traditionalist culture. No longer will women have to languish because they are supposedly inferior, and no longer will ethnic minorities have to suffer from racism here in Russia!"
 NIK_bukharina_introduce_the_creches_desc:0 "Family is a complex issue. While familial ties have always been the core of society, the fact remains that many bad traditions and inequalities are passed down through them. In order to rectify this, we have begun an experimental program in which children will be raised communally. This communal raising, called creches, will be the forefront of the experiments on if phasing out contemporary families is possible and feasible. We will keep this program opt-in and small for now, as we are not sure if the creche system is superior to the family system. Socialism is about moving forward, in the end, if the creches succeed, we will be able to move forward from the outdated system of families!"
 NIK_bukharina_a_place_for_the_family_desc:0 "While the family may have its issues, dissolving the family is more trouble than it's worth, as the cohesion and support it provides to a society is unmatched by communal child-raising. The better option is to promote egalitarian relations within a family. The wife does not have to stay at home, as she has every right to go to work. Furthermore, children, as they grow into adults, are not obligated to listen to the every command of their parents. By promoting egalitarian ideals within the family, we can hopefully break the traditionalist cycles nestled within, allowing for the revolutionary potential of a family to truly shine through."
 NIK_bukharina_strike_down_traditionalism_desc:0 "In the chaos of the Russian anarchy, the people turned to traditionalism and religion. Now that we have ended warlordism in the west, we have to show the people the trappings of said traditionalism. It may seem beneficial to stick to the ancient truths, but it is those very truths that stagnate society. We shall use the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation in order to help uplift the people to a modern socialist ideal!"
 NIK_bukharina_encourage_experimentalism_desc:0 "We must encourage experimentalist art amongst our people. For far too long, artists have stuck to the old ways because they are old. While the classics of art may be beautiful, they are not the only way to acquire beauty in art. It is time for the people to broaden their horizons so that they are not bound by the chains of conservative antiquity!"
 NIK_bukharina_foundations_of_the_peoples_society_desc:0 "It seems that our social reforms have begun to bear fruit. More and more, people treat others with respect, as compared to the contempt they would have before. However, just because our reforms are working, doesn't mean we can merely stop now. We must always keep moving forward so that we can create an ideal socialist society!"
 NIK_bukharina_making_the_peace_desc:0 "While we have stamped out most organized resistance to our rule, there are still rabble rousers who seek to revolt against our regime and undo our social reforms. We must task the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation to preserve the order, and ensure that we do not become unstable!"
 NIK_bukharina_continue_land_expropriation_desc:0 "A surprising problem we have run into during our consolidation of West Siberia is the issue of land. Many peasants own a pittance of land at best, while landlords are worryingly common. We must rectify this by distributing all land in West Siberia so that the people have the land they need in order to survive and prosper!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_universal_soviet_desc:0 "We are all human, in the end. We are all workers, and peasants, and people. There is a certain unity, no matter how much the capitalist says otherwise, that exists between us all. We must show the people the idea of the universal Soviet, that we all work towards a common goal in one grand union!"
 NIK_bukharina_eyes_on_the_unproven_desc:0 "The various governments of West Siberia have not exactly been pro-socialist. Knowing this, and the conclusion that the people have been inoculated against socialism, we must step up our surveillance efforts against the people of West Siberia to prevent them from revolting against us."
 NIK_bukharina_trust_the_peoples_goodwill_desc:0 "The people are not their government. Even if the government was reactionary, the people may very well not be the same. We have to ensure that we accept the people of West Siberia, as opposed to treating them with suspicion. After all, it is trust that helps build a better government."
 NIK_bukharina_the_benevolent_state_desc:0 "More than anything, the state is a critical part of socialist society. It helps provide for the people, and ensure that the freedoms and socialist ideals of the people are upheld. If we must keep a watch on the populace through surveillance to ensure that freedom and socialism is upheld by all, then so be it."
 NIK_bukharina_all_power_to_the_soviets_desc:0 "We must rearrange the government so that it is governed more on a regional level. This primarily means giving power to the regional Soviets. Of course, while we will let them handle their affairs, we must also keep an eye to ensure that the Soviets do not become controlled by reactionaries."
 NIK_bukharina_a_future_to_be_proud_of_desc:0 "Now that the vast majority of our reforms have been completed for now, we can march onwards towards reunifying Russia. Furthermore, we can build a future that we can be proud of, where equality truly exists and the people are happy!"

 NIK_zhdanov_the_march_of_revolutionary_progress_desc:0 "For years we have struggled under the reign of the counterrevolutionary and the Luddite, who find comfort in the darkness of ignorance. Yet now, years after Russia's collapse into a dark age of ignorance, we stand upon the brink of a brave new era, marching onwards into the light! No more shall the reactionaries keep us chained to infighting and petty warlordism! We shall craft a new Russia from the ashes of the old, ascending to achieve the Soviet superculture!\n\nThe antiquated democracies and dictatorships shall melt away before the grandeur of ultravisionary socialism, the only true path forward for our nation and our species. First, however, we must prepare for the push to retake Siberia from the regressives who claim to be the rightful leaders of Russia."
 NIK_zhdanov_unity_in_purpose_desc:0 "It will be many years before the Paramount Leader's ultimate vision of a spacefaring multispecies collective is fulfilled, but we are closer than ever to that goal. However, before we take our rightful place amongst the stars, we must first deal with earthly matters. Great swathes of our territory are still controlled by a rival government, preventing the industrialization we need to fund our future and denying those under their rule to participate in the grand collective we are assembling.\n\nBut even worse, the Germans have returned their stolen lands to a state of regressive oppression, forcing the people of Moskowien into a stagnant and repressive hierarchy. We must put an end to their misdeeds and incorporate the peoples of that territory into the supertculture, and to do that, we must restore our control of Siberia's resources."
 NIK_zhdanov_unity_in_ideology_desc:0 "To succeed in our goals, Russia must be totally united, not just in geography, but aligned on the principles of the new Soviet state. Achievement of the superculture requires a complete alignment of the citizenry on all fronts, so that we might transcend our earthly bonds. To facilitate the process of cultural conversion we have prepared a new version of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia in line with the principles outlined by the Paramount Leader, to elucidate the values of ultravisionary socialism. This will ensure that every citizen is mentally prepared for the creation of an intersolar nation."
 NIK_zhdanov_assess_the_reclaimed_territories_desc:0 "We are under no illusions about the difficulties inherent in our venture to create a unifying superculture from the disparate masses of humanity. Still, against all odds we have subsumed millions of individuals into our collective, and now possess a great deal of new territory along with all the resources that come with it.\n\nAbove all, the oil fields we have captured will provide us with power, fuel, and funding for our projects. Our tractors, tanks, and soon our rockets shall run on this black gold, propelling our expansion into the lost territories to the east. The remainder shall be sold to fund our scientific projects, serving the interests of the Soviet people. An administrative committee will be created to evaluate the qualities and uses of this and other resources, and ensure maximum efficiency of our efforts."
 NIK_zhdanov_absorb_the_sverdlovsk_design_bureau_desc:0 "The Sverdlovsk Design Bureau was one of the most effective scientific installations in Western Siberia, established under the purview of Konstantin Rokossovsky, a talented general who was sadly unsuited to the demands of the superculture. However, his creation is responsible for many breakthroughs in the art of modern warfare and the technology needed for it.\n\nA more effective fighting force will be necessary to consolidate the bountiful resources of Russia for our own purposes, and the Sverdlovsk Bureau must be consolidated into the greater structure for the benefit of all."
 NIK_zhdanov_rehabilitate_the_personnel_desc:0 "Scientific minds are not just highly educated and useful, the men who possess them are highly advanced thinkers and the best suited to lead in the days ahead. Most men do not adapt quickly to the new demands of the day, and our leaders must do it most of all. These men must be fellow architects of the superculture, each doing his part to make humanity transcend its limitations and build a brave new world.\n\nWe have recently acquired several scientists from Sverdlovsk whose experience in military applications of sciences will make fine additions to the collective. Prepare to rehabilitate them as ultravisonary leaders. With their expertise, we shall touch the stars."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_ultravisionary_method_desc:0 "The Paramount Leader, and the future of humanity, stands before a critical decision.\n\nWill we seek to establish ourselves as the dominant terrestrial power, eliminating the regressives of Germania and freeing millions of workers to participate in the establishment of our new superculture? Or will we secure our ascendancy by developing technology that would have been unthinkable only mere decades ago, and boldly transgressing the most optimistic expectations of the reactionaries and even our own scientists?\n\nThis choice will determine the distribution of our resources for years to come. In our unification, there can be no half-measures."
 NIK_zhdanov_applied_zhdanovshchina_desc:0 "Ultravisionary socialism must establish itself as the dominant and undisputed power upon this terrestrial body before presenting itself to extraterrestrial beings as a superior mode of society. The superculture cannot be challenged by external forces, especially not in a critical moment of first contact with an unknown civilization. It would drastically reduce our credibility to introduce ourselves as merely another of the powers of our divided world.\n\nAs such, we must prepare operations to weaken those who would see us dragged back into the cave of ignorance, secure all the resources we can from them, and manufacture circumstances so as to achieve dominance over the world. As long as the superculture remains vulnerable to Earth-bound influences, stellar adventures will have to wait."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_way_for_humanity_is_open_desc:0 "Why should a titan meddle with the ants beneath their notice? Germany is divided and weak, a tottering tower on the brink of collapse. Japan is much the same. The West is embroiled in their usual capitalist squabbles. We are above all this petty bickering. The creation and expansion of the superculture should be our concern, above all else.\n\nThis decision will of course have consequences, consequences which are inescapable. Reallocation of our resources to expanding the new frontier will require sacrifices from the Soviet people for the benefit of the whole, as is outlined in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia.\n\nThe obsolete governments of the West are bound to the Earth. We are bound for the stars."
 NIK_zhdanov_necessary_material_conditions_desc:0 "The German invasion has set back our progress by an unacceptable degree, and one of the greatest weaknesses of our new Russia is the living conditions of its people. Infrastructure has been broken apart, cutting our citizens off from networks of guidance created by cities. Farms have been burned and salted, reducing our population's ability to fulfill the most basic of human needs.\n\nThis is an unacceptable state for the Soviet superculture to be in. The individual units of the collective must be functional for it to function at full capacity, and so we must uplift the lowest among us before we can uplift humanity. The broken links between dissolute portions of humanity must be repaired on a physical and psychological level, and we shall never allow ourselves to be divided again!"
 NIK_zhdanov_observe_cultural_shifts_desc:0 "It is not enough to shape and mold the superculture. The sculptor must monitor his clay, particularly when he works with such materials as the human race, and ensure it is formed and fired properly. Conformity to the principles of the Paramount Leader is to be encouraged, while deviation is to be corrected. Active deviation is to be forcefully corrected.\n\nTo this end, we shall deploy trained architects of the superculture, to monitor every facet of life for the collection of data, obtain feedback on the efficacy of our methods, and detect regressives within our ranks for prompt reeducation. Those who would disrupt the Paramount Leader's plans disrupt the progress of mankind, and shall not be tolerated in any form."
 NIK_zhdanov_society_redefined_desc:0 "From such small beginnings, we have come so far. With the majority of our enemies defeated, the undisputed control of our lands has been solidified. Our fighting forces grow strong on the back of scientific discovery and innovation. Literature and language is putty in our hands, shaped to our benefit. Our brightest minds construct rockets and discuss the spread of socialism across borders, and between the stars.\n\nAnd beyond the stars, our destiny awaits, to show the universe the power of ultravisionary socialism. We shall complete Phase One of Comrade Kardashev's plan for civilization, achieving mastery over our planet, and prove ourselves the heralds of mankind's ascension!\n\nThe superculture shall unite as one, and as one, we go forth."
 NIK_zhdanov_glory_to_the_ones_who_look_forward_desc:0 "The banner of Lenin is over us\nWe've come to build happiness!\nWith the young hands,\nwe write the biography of the Earth!\n\nGlory to the ones who look forward!\nGlory to the ones who march forward!\nOur path is from the present to the stellar future!\nOur path is from the present to the coming years!\n\nYouth like a stellar rocket,\nascends upward every day!\nWe will light clear dawns\nAbove the Motherland!"

 NIK_a_grand_step_forwards_desc:0 "The reborn Soviet Union grows yet stronger, driven onwards by the inexorable currents of history. No amount of fascist violence or particularist deviance can prevent the restoration of the true workers' state. Western Siberia, with its population, industrial hubs and rich agricultural land, is restored to the rightful government of the proletariat. Half of the Motherland is now liberated; we shall begin the process of reintegration and cleaning up the mess that our enemies have made immediately."
 NIK_extend_the_apparatus_desc:0 "Siberia has been deprived of proper socialist governance for too long. The reactionary juntas, criminals and revisionists have left us with a sorry assortment of ineffective bureaucracies and backwards local administrations. This will not do. The people demand that their Siberian brothers and sisters are granted the full benefits of our renewed socialist society - Comrade Suslov shall see that it is done! Soon, cities and villages alike will be filled with smiling workers and peasants, cheering on the advance of the revolution as it reclaims all of Russia."
 NIK_supervise_the_union_desc:0 "Siberia is not as refined and orderly as it should be. Crime, banditry and rebellion continue to blight the land. Such is the natural outcome of societal breakdown and the absence of a strong, ideologically consistent government. The workers demand order and security, and General Secretary Suslov will make it so. Police presence in the region will be increased tenfold. Of course, this will in turn require further expansion of our robust security apparatus - a small, harmless reform that the Party is more than happy to endorse. All Siberians shall rest easy under our constant vigilance."
 NIK_the_heart_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "The workers of the world are all equal, but those of Russia were the first to embrace the revolution in its true form and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat. Our comrades around the world have sadly forgotten this fact, owing to our defeat at the hands of fascism - but that was merely a temporary setback. The champion of international socialism is risen once more, strong as ever and buoyed aloft by the spirit of solidarity. Now that we are a global player again, we shall spread the good news to every corner of the Earth. Workers, rejoice - for the revolution has returned!"
 NIK_anti_corruption_initiatives_desc:0 "Sadly, despite our efforts to eventually become a post-money society, the allure of wealth remains a potent incentive towards criminal behavior. Corruption, that most capitalist of diseases, threatens to become common practice in our bureaucracy. This state of affairs is unacceptable, but conventional methods have proven ineffective against its spread. Perhaps it is time to fight fire with fire? The promise of financial reward to those willing to inform on corrupt colleagues might do more to curb the problem than any amount of investigations or tribunals."
 NIK_expunge_the_secret_societies_desc:0 "A twin-headed monster lurks, wounded but still alive, in the forests of Siberia. Upon its left shoulder rests the serpentine head of revisionism, hissing falsehoods with a forked tongue and leading workers astray. To its right sits the snarling visage of fascism, muzzle red with the peoples' blood. The beast is the double threat of the Stalinists and the Black League, equally guilty of crimes against socialism, the Motherland and her people. The remnants of these traitors must be expunged from Siberia to make way for sensible, humane socialism, that the wounds of the nation might be bound and healed."
 NIK_a_hand_to_the_khrushchevites_desc:0 "Even the splitters have splitters. The so-called Stalinists find themselves divided between those loyal to the chauvinist, reactionary Frankensteinian ideas of Kaganovich, and the more orthodox and progressive clique of Khrushchev. The latter still differ from our established Party line to a worrying degree, but perhaps we can return them to the correct path. Lenient, perhaps - but Khrushchev is a charismatic and popular man who commands great respect within the Party, especially from those with more forward-thinking tendencies."
 NIK_increase_socintern_funding_desc:0 "Russia is a fount of natural resources, giving us significant economic clout on the global stage. We can easily rake in billions from trade, and Comrade Suslov has exactly the right idea for where these righteous profits should be directed: the Socialist International. Failure to cooperate with the international proletariat has been the death of many a promising revolution, and we shall not repeat that mistake. The workers of the world will be united, and Soviet roubles will make it happen."
 NIK_repress_potential_deviants_desc:0 "The rise of another Bukharina or Zhdanov is a possibility we cannot abide. Despite their dedication to socialism, those two splitters frequently endangered the cause with selfish factionalism, setting a dangerous precedent for future generations. The Party cannot allow ideological deviance to become normalized. We must be on the lookout for any potential splitters rising through the ranks, that we might snuff out their ambitions and maintain socialism as Marx and Lenin intended it."
 NIK_accept_the_young_planners_desc:0 "Though many of the younger generation born after the time of Lenin and Bukharin tend towards unorthodox thought, they are not lost to us. They are like awkward teenagers getting a feel for their pubescent bodies, full of questions and confusion. On occasion, they glean some great insight amidst the chaos of change and become agents of socialism's future development. By vetting their ideas and encouraging growth rather than simply suppressing them outright, we can cultivate the next generation of great socialist thinkers. Someday, the current leaders of the proletariat will be gone; learned, intelligent and innovative successors will be needed to take their place."
 NIK_reform_party_membership_desc:0 "Membership of the Communist Party should mean something more than what it currently does. As-is, it seems that true believers are outnumbered by career bureaucrats seeking advancement. We are the vanguard of the socialist revolution, not a means by which ambitious men can put themselves above their comrades! Party membership should be accompanied with a set of obligations and standards to strengthen our legitimacy as the representatives of the proletariat. Those who fail to meet expectations will be expelled so that someone more deserving and reliable can take their place."
 NIK_emphasize_anti_imperialism_desc:0 "Make no mistake; the capitalist West is no friend to the proletariat. Even if fascism is the greater evil, it was capitalism's failings that led to its creation in the first place. That they now quarrel with one another is no concern to us. We know our path and will follow it; it shall never be a lonely one, for we have the workers of all nations by our side. We shall loudly and unequivocally condemn all imperialism, be it born of fascism or capitalism, for ultimately they differ only in their methods."
 NIK_a_strategic_orientation_desc:0 "We must face facts: the Soviet Union is not in a position to pick a fight with the West. They may be oppressive imperialists, but it was the Germans and their allies who invaded the Motherland and drove us from our homes. One does not look to the distant wolf when the bear is breaking down the door. Though the Americans can never be trusted so long as their corrupt kleptocratic institutions remain, aligning ourselves with the greater cause of defeating fascism is the responsible course of action."
 NIK_the_international_vanguard_desc:0 "Long have we waited for this day. There are those who said it would never come, that the revolution was finished; what have they to say now? The people and workers of the Soviet Union are reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. Fascists, revisionists and reactionaries fall before us like wheat before the scythe! Nothing can defeat the courage and resolve of a united proletariat, mighty and invincible! Today, Siberia; tomorrow, the hills of Manchuria!"

Second, the development of spaceflight technology shall bring us ever closer to the stars, and the ultimate progress of ultravisionary socialism."

Russia was broken into pieces, and now, in the crucible of reunification, we shall forge a superculture to stand the test of time. None shall stand in the way of our ascendance- not the capitalist decadence of the west, nor the oppressive fascists of Germany, nor the atavistic banditry of the warlord years. United in our goals, we march forward in lockstep, to the destinations that only ultravisionaries can perceive.\n\nFor what is a single voice, compared to a magnificent chorus?"

 andropov.1.t:0 "Another Late Night in Syktyvkar"
 andropov.1.d:0 "Yuri Andropov sighed as he lazily tapped the butt of his cigarette against the ashtray, watching with no real interest as the ashes drifted to the bottom of the small glass container. Yet another late night at the office. The light patter of rain against the window drew his eyes to the dark, muggy streets of Syktyvkar outside. He rose to his feet and brought the cigarette to his lips as he surveyed the city. It was quiet tonight; too quiet for his tastes.\n\nSometimes, young members of the communist party, whispering in each other's ears without a care in the world, would comment on Mikhail Suslov's secrecy - his paranoia. The Party was a safe place, they'd whine. They were all comrades there, right? Perhaps he could just loosen up a little.\n\nUsually they'd shut up when Yuri tapped them on the shoulder and asked them if they wanted to share their opinions with the class. Then they'd know who the real shadow of the Party was.\n\nAndropov snickered at the memory and shook his head. His job wasn't all just scaring dumb kids - it was to do what needed to be done to ensure Party stability - or to disappear whoever had earned Suslov's ire. The latest list of names to investigate Mikhail had given him was, all things considered, damn boring for the most part; one name, however, caught his attention. Svetlana Bukharina.\n\nHe had met the kid a few times, he remembered, blowing some smoke out onto the window. She spoke like Yuri imagined a princess would, all prim and proper, smiled as she shook his hand, the works. It's how he knew she was dangerous. Her father was like that too. A wonderful man, if you were on his good side - but there was a venom hidden behind his eyes, and he saw that behind hers too.\n\nAs Yuri watched, a bolt of lightning lit up the city. For a moment, it almost seemed like it was on fire. He wondered then if it was a sign of what Svetlana could do.\n\nHe shook his head and tossed the cigarette into the ashtray."
 andropov.1.a:0 "Just another threat, or an unexpected ally?"
 
 andropov.2.t:0 "A Midnight Walk"
 andropov.2.d:0 "Yuri shoved his hands in the pockets of his coat, a vain attempt to keep them warm as he trudged through the downpour. Almost reflexively, his hand curled around the grip of the gun that always sat in his right-hand pocket. He always carried at least two weapons on him. The knife in his boot, and the tokarev in his pocket - you never knew who would be out to silence you in this town.\n\nThings were moving faster these days than they had in years - Lenin was certainly right about that. Sometimes decades happened in the span of weeks. The kid was a goddamned savant at the political game - Bukharina, he corrected himself. In just a few short weeks she'd rapidly moved up in the party and had cemented herself as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nSomething told Yuri she wouldn't stop rising there. She was like a goddamned force of nature in the party, one that Suslov was growing increasingly worried about - and therein lied Yuri's choice.\n\nGiving her a good word to the General Secretary would keep her safe for a while longer - and Yuri had a feeling she'd capitalize on that. Good investment.\n\nOn the other hand, a part of him said to wait and see. If his feeling about her was right, she'd be able to claw her way to Suslov herself."
 andropov.2.a:0 "Let her fight her own battles."
 andropov.2.b:0 "Put in a good word."

 andropov.3.t:0 "Fighting a Losing Battle"
 andropov.3.d:0 "Yuri Andropov was nothing if not a smart man, he reasoned with himself with some satisfaction; his hunch on Bukharina was certainly a correct one, hell, she had risen far beyond his expectations. Suslov hadn't seemed to worry about her growing beyond control, but Yuri certainly had - and who was right in the end?\n\nA smirk crossed his lips as he trudged home. It had been a very productive meeting with several prominent 'revisionists', as Suslov would have called them. Yuri would have called them smart people. He wasn't exactly a bleeding heart when it came to how to best implement Socialism, but he was a smart man.\n\nThese people were, whether he personally liked it or not, the future. Bukharina - hell, even Zhdanov, to some extent - they were the ones who were going to lead the Party to the future, not Suslov. Though they may have initially distrusted him as a hardliner, they certainly didn't after tonight.\n\nAndropov chuckled to himself. The game was afoot, and he certainly intended to pick a winning side."
 andropov.3.a:0 "Out with the old."

 andropov.4.t:0 "Check"
 andropov.4.d:0 ""- I've seen the way the tide's turning, Comrade. There's no future in the past - but there is one with you."\n\nSvetlana Bukharina's eyebrow raised.\n\n"While I'm glad you've seen the light, Comrade Andropov, you'll need for forgive me for my disbelief. You served as Suslov's attack dog for years. How can I trust you?"\n\nAndropov shrugged. He expected the suspicion, and he had come prepared. From within his overcoat pocket he withdrew a small pocketbook and held it out to the woman. As she opened it, her eyes widened, and Yuri couldn't help but smile.\n\n"All of your opponents' dirty little secrets. Things that'd surely turn the party against them if they somehow leaked."\n\n"Comrade Andropov, I have the feeling this will be the start of a very beneficial friendship for the both of us."\n\n"I hope so, Comrade Bukharina. I hope so.""
 andropov.4.a:0 "Almost there."

 andropov.5.t:0 "Checkmate"
 andropov.5.d:0 ""-... And in your capacities as head of the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation, your duties will include ensuring the immediate cessation of counter-revolutionary activity wherever it may rear its' ugly head, ensuring the safety of the Soviet State, and keeping the people safe from all other hidden threats. Do you understand, Comrade Andropov?"\n\nYuri smiled. "I do, Comrade Bukharina."\n\nThis was it, then. The bet he had made such a long time ago in Syktyvkar had finally paid off. From fixer to intelligence director. Not a bad career path, if he said so himself.\n\n"Good," Bukharina continued. "Then I believe we're done here."\n\nYuri moved to exit her office. "And Yuri?" She spoke as he left. He turned to face her, surprised to see a genuine smile spread across her face.\n\n"Good luck."\n\nHe returned the smile with one of his own. Somewhere along the line they'd actually became friends, it seemed.\n\n"You too, Comrade. You too.""
 andropov.5.a:0 "Another win."
 

 bukharina.1.t:0 "The Victory of Reform"
 bukharina.1.d:0 "As she approached the microphone, Svetlana Bukharina suppressed a nervous tremble. It had finally happened. She had finally achieved what she had set out to do so long ago.\n\nAfter years spent in obscurity, after more spent concealing her ambitions from those who saw her as useful only for her name, and after yet more spent in the consolidation of Western Russia, she, and through extension the people, had triumphed. And she had no intention, of allowing the opportunities now offered to be wasted.\n\nWatching the technician carefully, she began speaking the moment he indicated that the microphone was active. She began by speaking of triumph, by thanking all those listening for their efforts - and sacrifices - in support of the state's victory. Very quickly, however, she moved to speak of what the future held. Of how she intended to change their lives for the better.\n\nSocialism, she said, rested at the natural apex of political thought, for it combined economic progress and collective human care. But all too often it had not been implemented in proper fashion. By her predecessors. By other so-called revolutionary states. By, she said with regret, of her father's Union. She intended to correct this.\n\nProgressive economic and social policies were to be soon introduced, and those obstructing such reform would be swept aside. Equality, of all kinds, would be emphasized, continuing the legacy of some who had come long before and ensuring that Russia was known as a champion of equitable action.\n\nChange, she promised those listening, was imminent. They needed only to watch, and reap the rewards besides."
 bukharina.1.a:0 "A new day for true socialism."
 
 bukharina.2.t:0 "The Selection Process"
 bukharina.2.d:0 "Bukharina is a woman of measured and deliberate tones, but the exhaustion in her voice is all too real as she begins the announcement. So, too, is her triumph. The Congress of the Soviets has been formed, the long struggle over who to select and who to reject for the Presidium finished. It is coming to a close, at long last, and the business of real governance can truly begin.\n\nHer hand trembles as she reads aloud the words, each blending into the next, and the Congress registers her candidates with polite and faceless nods. A unionist here. A politician there. A general or two thrown in for diversity's sake. She can't quite remember the specifics of everything anymore - her head is trembling with the effort necessary to stand as it is - but what she does know is that while she was still lucid, she had taken measures to build the broadest possible base.\n\nShe will not repeat the mistakes of her father. Never again will Russia crumble from the errors of a few.\n\nShe stumbles, almost trips and falls. Panic echoes through the Congress, and guards stand to help her up. She waves them off - a leader always stands up before her people, she thinks - and resumes reading. A police officer, one of the few good ones, she thinks, and she's finished at last. Polite applause comes as her speech ends. She staggers out of the podium, stumbles into her seat and takes a long, long swing of the devil's brew.\n\nShe barely has time to let it down her throat when the first rejection comes. The unionist is a good choice, yes, but according to the remarks he made to a speech in so-and-so factory, his allegiances to independent unionism are rather in doubt. And as for his own capacities to build the Revolution, has the Chairwoman not noticed his work with so-and-so employers?\n\nBukharina stares blearily into the Congress, head unbowed. Something raw and primal inside her wants to burst into a long, silent scream, and in the spaces of her head, she indulges it."
 bukharina.2.a:0 "I hate bureaucracy."

 bukharina.3.t:0 "Soviet Humanism"
 bukharina.3.d:0 "Despite the many questions being asked of him, the professor remained patient and composed. He could not blame the students for their confusion. After all, like them, he too had been removed from academia for many, many years, having only returned with the imposition of renewed order.\n\nAs he answered another such question, he took care to emphasize the importance of the 'Soviet' in the all-important concept of Soviet Humanism. The distinction was critical, he announced to the lecture hall, and could not be overlooked, at least if one were to truly understand the system.\n\nHumanism, he declared, was well-understood to represent the belief in promotion of human agency, and of the inherent value of every human being. But it had also traditionally been defined through a non-socialist lens, with the position of that agency within hierarchies - political or ecclesiastical - being a subject of intense focus. And this acceptance of such a social construct was inherently divisive. Inherently destructive.\n\nSoviet Humanism accounted for this, and in doing so, elevated the philosophy tremendously. By eliminating religious considerations, emphasizing egalitarian social policy, and reorienting the lens from external hierarchies and factors to internal improvement, within both the individual and the state as a whole, it promised progress on a scale never before seen.\n\nIt promised to, truly and finally, place humanity at the forefront of thought. Who, the professor asked, could possibly argue against such a goal? With conviction of any kind?\n\nAt that, there were no more questions."
 bukharina.3.a:0 "An achievable goal?"

 bukharina.4.t:0 "In All Things, Equal"
 bukharina.4.d:0 "Occasionally, when Marianna had the time and her overseer wasn't looking, she'd slip away to a place she knew: the industrial floodlights shone on almost everything, but they hid certain alleys with their bulk just as easily. There she would read, page after page, the works that kept her alive. Her parents had died young, and all she'd known as she grew to adulthood was this: fluorescent lighting, endless queues of machinery and the quiet sorrow of being alive.\n\nBut Kollontai's words kept her going. There was a fire in them, an inexpressible celebration, that let Marianna know who she really was: in her words, for the first time in what had been an otherwise utterly unnoticed life, she felt heard. When her supervisor ignored her pleas for paid overtime, when her colleagues snickered at her slower pace and tentative moves, when she was tired, abandoned and so alone it hurt -\n\nShe would run to her hiding place, flip to the page, so well-browsed it was fastened to the spine by sheer willpower, and read the words, "Certainly not the woman worker. She is her own savior. Her future is in her own hands." She read it over and over and over again. Occasionally tears would slip out and dry on the smoothed, weathered paper, like little blossoms. Then she would return to her workplace, her pain seemingly cast aside.\n\nWhen the Soviet Representative came to the factory, she was ready. Scarcely had the words Marxist Feminism flowed from the Representative's mouths when she rose to speak, talking almost too fast for comprehension. She spoke of the need of her fellow workers to fight alongside her, not undercut her position, and as she spoke she almost wept with the relief.\n\nIn the silence that followed, she packed her things with trembling hands left the factory. For the first time in years, she knew what she had to do. She began walking, not quite sure where she would go but certain she was headed for a better place."
 bukharina.4.a:0 "The liberation, in the end, was her own."

 bukharina.5.t:0 "A Principled Response To Gender Revisionism"
 bukharina.5.d:0 "Socialist Workers! We have heard the cries of the Revisionist in our struggle to build a world for the Dignity of the Proletarian. The Revisionist says one of three things; FIRST, that women are physically incapable; SECOND, that women are emotionally hysterical; THIRD, that to embrace equality would ruin our traditions. Let us consider the following:\n\nTO THE FIRST, we argue that women are NO MORE physically incapable than are men! Women are rarely seen in manual labor because they have NOT been given the chance to work outside the home; indeed, raising a home with little support from a husband can be oppression in itself!\n\nTO THE SECOND, we reply that women are, far from hysterical, the more composed sex. Was Hitler not a male? It was under the charge of MALE leaders, not female, that the world was swept in war and horror; and it was under the Bourgeois Dictatorship of the Intellect that the world LEARNED to associate Maleness with Wisdom, and Femaleness with Chaos. This is oppression in itself!\n\nTO THE THIRD, we retort that the same traditions that give Russia its 'values' have led it into error, again and again! Because Russia loved the Tsar, it SLAVERED before his gaze and expected reprieve from the First War, and was shocked when the Tsar answered their begging with BULLETS. Because Russia loved tradition, it hesitated when the clarion call came to build itself up with the rest of the World, and for it, we were CRUSHED as Hitler's savages came for us. Our infatuation with tradition will lead us to embrace only the GRAVE!\n\nComrades! You have heard the call for Revolution - let us obey, and fight to the end against all the shackles that Reactionism imposes upon us! Modernity, and the Classless Future, awaits the brave!"
 bukharina.5.a:0 "Reject Tradition! Embrace Modernity!"

 bukharina.6.t:0 "A Principled Response To The Crypto-Orthodox"
 bukharina.6.d:0 "Socialist Workers! We have heard the cries of the hidden Counter-Revolutionaries that call themselves NICODEMITES, the hidden Christians. The Nicodemite claims three defenses: FIRST, that the Orthodox Church must be preserved to keep Russia blessed by God; SECOND, that the Church contains many within its walls that are innocent; THIRD, that the tearing down of churches will destroy our cultural heritage. Let us consider:\n\nTO THE FIRST, we respond that the so-called 'PRESERVATION' of Russia's Church led to its near defeat in the Great War, and has done nothing for us since the release of the SERFS! Religion is an OPIATE of the masses, and our duty as class-conscious workers is to WAKE the masses from their drugged slumber. For that is worth any amount of forfeited 'blessings'!\n\nTO THE SECOND, we demand a retraction of this INSULT to our workers. Our Workers' Battalions are imbued with the most HUMANE of class values, and would gladly give their lives for the defense of the INNOCENT. They attack only the hidden predators of the working class, who ABSCOND with the wealth of the masses in the name of religion! Those who are not enemies of the workers have nothing to fear!\n\nTO THE THIRD, we call only for a demonstration of the so-called VALUES these Churches preserve! Do the accumulated wealth and power accrued by the PRIESTS not indicate that, far from being our moral guardians, the Church has in fact acted as our collective RACKETEERS? Let us be AWARE, comrades! The Church cares nothing for tradition, nor for the soul - unless one's soul is contained within one's WALLET!\n\nComrades! The State has called for Revolution, and let us unceasingly vie to outdo each other in zeal to fulfil the mandate! Destroy the strength of this accumulated REACTIONARY force, and let the Revolution emerge as our true and better Salvation!"

 bukharina.7.t:0 "A Principled Response to the Working Oppressor"
 bukharina.7.d:0 "COMRADES! You have heard the cries of the Parasite that LABELS himself a so-called "CHAMPION of WOMANHOOD" in our Muslim comrades' names. The Working Oppressor, for that is his name, claims that: FIRST, that the women involved are willing to wear face-veils; SECOND, that removing these veils will scare their husbands and fathers from Socialism; THIRD, that Socialism is not incompatible with the wearing of veils. Consider:\n\nTO THE FIRST, we have only SCORN for the fools and dullards who believe these women are not COERCED. The reactionary apparatus HYPNOTIZES innocent women into SELF-VICTIMHOOD - that is precisely why they struggle with us when we RIP the illusions from their faces! Let us ceaselessly destroy their illusions - when they come to their senses, they will THANK us.\n\nTO THE SECOND, we are UTTERLY CONTEMPTUOUS of the idea that these so-called "swinging Socialists" would ever be pure enough for the REVOLUTION in the First Place. Our creed calls for the SELF-CRITICISM of every aspect of their reactionary lives, and yet it is the removal of some SENSELESS VEILS that destroys the fabric of their communities!

Nothing else had changed. Why would it?\n\nEverything began to crumble when the order came in from Central. President's orders were to release everything in a comprehensible format. Nice, safe and orderly. Well, Tabashnikov knew then that he had to be the one to review his own records. It was the only way to preserve his skin - and his service to the people. Too much lay in the balance to risk it. He gave strict orders to his secretary to lock the records down and left for the weekend, to settle accounts.\n\nHe forgot, of course, that his deputies had been appointed to the task as well - and that they had been granted equal access with the very same decree that had opened the records.\n\nAs Tabashnikov returned, he found his deputies staring at him with something between disgust, fear and pity on their faces - and a cold-faced bureaucrat with a very, very unamused expression.

She placed another binder upon the table; this one landed like a feather, but none dared look at its contents - precisely because they already knew what it was.\n\nThe President moved past the dizzying heights of rage and took flight into the rarefied heights of cold, calm fury. The room fell even more silent than it had previously been. Several staffers made motions to escape for a toilet break, fleeing at the minutest of nods.\n\n"I am only going to ask this once. Can I be assured that no such attacks will happen again?" The Chief of Police's averted gaze told her all she needed to know. "Very well.

Gather the Directorate for Revolutionary Preservation and call the Head of the Presidium to my office."\n\nUpon her lips was affixed something that looked like a smile, and yet was so utterly constricted it looked more like a particularly painful rictus.

What they did next would make them all monsters in equal measures. There would be blood enough to share.\n\nClearing her throat, she rose to speak. "I have called you here today in view of your oath.

This armistice is henceforth suspended. All necessary measures are to be taken to remove them - social circles and sympathizers are to be considered complicit."\n\nA tentative voice rose from the rear.

In the blackest hours of the morning, when only cleaning crews and the on-duty URS agents were present, they always shone so beautifully - a perfect complement to the friendly smell of the teacup on her desk, and the sweet, romantic jazz that the record player was playing. In her way, this was her personal paradise - alone, peaceful, and victorious, lounging in her chair in a way that she would never allow to be photographed. It was the calmest part of the week - the time that she had to herself, to sit in her solitary office and get a few minutes of reflection and relaxation.\n\nMoving her feet off of the desk's surface, and swiveling the chair around, she looked back out the half-shuttered window once more. In the distance, red fireworks were being fired off - celebrations by her supporters, no doubt, of the final neutralization of the sadly misguided opposition. Their own Victory Day. It was a gesture she approved of, privately. Celebration, making a positive example - those who tragically resisted progress would eventually come around, exposed to the joy and community of true progressive society. Repression past a certain point would merely lead their ideals to form their metaphorical fortresses.\n\nShe took a sip of tea and closed her eyes, moving a single finger in the air as if conducting the music.

Piece by piece I was drawn with you - drawn by you, rather - into a web of lies, deceit, layer upon layer of hidden truths, and I accepted it because I wanted so desperately to believe in what you said. The Special Section of the Directorate, the Mission - you said Bukharina needed people to defend her, that the Left needed nightwatchmen, to protect it from the monsters in the night. Even as I began to see more than just money in the invoices I signed in my name for you, I believed in what you said.\n\nI see now that the only menace Bukharina needed protection from was your merry band. How could I possibly have ignored the invoices to Suslov? And as you smiled at me and promised that your alliance was nothing but a red herring, were you really thinking of me? Of us?\n\nKnow this, Anton Aronovich Pachikov. I stared into your eyes, so deep and rich like endless golden fields, as the red banners fluttered around us, and you promised never to leave me. I wish I had never swept into your arms. I wish I had never known you at all. And I cannot, no matter how painful it is to remember you, cast you aside. I will ask you one last time.\n\nAre you truly a Suslovite mole? Did what we shared mean nothing to you? Please, tell me. I will never see you again.

Why had Bukharina chosen such an innocuous young woman, with little experience and even less credentials within the Party, to lead the work? The Chairwoman was seldom accused of political interference, but there were outright rumours of corruption swirling around the woman from the start; the choice was so unexpected, it was hard to believe it had not been planned.\n\nWhen the Commission's first meeting kicked off, however, all doubts were dispelled. The woman, introduced only as Comrade Ekaterina, outlined an agenda so ambitious and detailed it could only have come from a consummate political operative. In days she pushed through a proposal outlining radical changes to women-specific wage rate laws and housing specifications, and within weeks it was on the floor of the Congress of the Soviets.\n\nEkaterina brought the Commission to vibrant action in other ways, too: it was quickly discovered that her connections to industry players had bought them all a window into the closed spaces of the business world. A dinner meeting became a formal invitation, and then spiraled into a full-blown conference complete with research initiatives. It was a dream come true for the Committee's members: it seemed that the sky was the limit with this mysterious young woman.\n\nAlthough most never thought to question the Committee Head, one member was not so naive. As Ekaterina was packing her things in the meeting room one evening, the Party Operative approached her and whispered that she knew who Ekaterina was - or at least who she had worked with. Industry access. Windows to all the spheres of government. Secret projects that appeared and disappeared at will. Only one ghost remained this influential in the Republic.\n\nEkaterina chuckled, and whispered to her: "Suslov is dead. I, however, am very much alive."

"A man of my age, dragged around in a glorified trolley. What would my wife say about all this?" As Bukharina chuckled, he went on. "You know, Svetlana, I never thought we'd get this far. Those early days in the Assembly, when we were just note-passers talking over teatime and gossiping - who'd ever have thought it?"\n\nThe iron in her voice must have surprised him, which was slightly disappointing in itself.

"I've noticed the Directorate's latest reports on loyalty in rank-and-file unions. Very well written, I'd have struggled to do better myself." Yuri tilted his head a little in acknowledgement, but said nothing.\n\nThe Chairwoman raised her cup to her lips, so what she said next could be heard clear in the echo. "Are there similar concerns with the leadership of the Directorate?" The glint on the cup was unnaturally bright. Yuri put the flash of light before him and the open window about two meters away together and chuckled to himself. The kid was growing fangs.\n\n"I do not believe so, Chairwoman." Of course, now the game was up the pistol in her handbag seemed almost gauche. But it was a good effort from an amateur.

It was useless to him, but perhaps obeying could get him out unharassed, without the unexpected quartet looking under the floorboards. Bukharina placed her book on the table, smiling to the children, before speaking.\n\n"I apologize for the unexpected visit, comrades," she begun, before presenting a piece of paper with some illegible text on it. "This village has been marked as the next stop for the liquidation of rural illiteracy. Has the local council informed you of your local liquidation point?"\n\nThe children tentatively inched towards the door. Vasily blinked once, uncomprehending. Did that mean- this was all an overly-threatening entrance for what he understood as a political reading group? The seeds of a chuckle escaped his mouth, to be strangled in a moment by anxiety.

A mirage through a telescope of time.\n\nWith some effort she wrested her attention to the present, and the letter awaiting her. She had no real desire to open it, because she knew how it read. The inevitable had come to pass. On the envelope was marked the words, SUSLOV - CONTINGENCY PLAN: VERMILLION RAT. In it were details of the operation that would remove her greatest remaining political opponent in the Republic. She'd been in the briefing herself: this last letter was merely a formality. All it would take was a stamp and a signature, and the paralysis of the Left in the Republic would come to an end.\n\nSo why did her hands tremble so as she thought? No, she felt no real remorse: she knew what had to be done. It felt...wrong, like cutting the last strings to one's anchor. And, in truth, Suslov was nothing without his supporters. Would a little mercy be too much to spare? Karby shrieked, and Bukharina rushed to soothe her feathers. She stood there, gently patting the bird, for a long time, the decision crystallizing in her head."

The funny thing was that it really wasn't that different from the work he'd done in his cavorting with Suslov: one glanced through dossiers, picking apart the details of someone's life and family and career, and at the end one made a choice. If the choice was positive, Andropov would add it to the large pile on the left: if not, to the small, neat and alphabetically arranged stack on the left. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAndropov had once made the mistake of talking to a priest about his line of work; the latter had mumbled something about the sheep and the goats, and then he'd retreated. Well, even without having read the Good Book Andropov knew what he was on about. His job was essentially that of a judge: the good and the bad, the assets and the liabilities. The quick and the dead.\n\nAnd there had been so very many of the latter in recent days, Yuri mused. For some reason Headquarters was sending over requests at a vastly increased rate, even compared to the early days of the Revolution. They were lucky that the Directorate had recently gotten a wave of new recruits. This stack had been the result of what he estimated to be three months' worth of labor. Otherwise...well, no Revolutionary state had survived the collapse of its security apparatus.\n\nA staffer poked his head out the side of the door, yelling: "Director Andropov! There's a fresh stack of work for you down the hall!"\n\nAndropov stretched his sore back, hiding a wry smile. The visionaries all sounded different, but his unceasing labor was, in the end, the same under every one of them. Well, he supposed, there was one factor which had changed."

She read through pages filled with pictures of Inca statues, African masks, Korean totems and more, finding herself immersed in the history of art. Idly, she looked towards the cabinet in the study, wondering if there was any hidden history in the trophies and valuables inside. Lost in her idle reverie, she barely registered the sound of the door opening.\n\n"Chairwoman?" Her secretary called, leaning out from outside. He was holding the white handset, covering the microphone. She turned her head, looking at the door. The book dropped, a shallow thud emanating from below.\n\n"Yes?"\n\n"Comrade Malinina wishes to speak to you." The Chairwoman opened her mouth to speak, but was cut off. "I understand that it is your off day today, but she says that it will be quick."\n\nSvetlana nodded, putting her book on the table. Straightening her outfit, she took the receiver. "Yulia?"\n\n"This may seem a bit sudden, but with all of your work on women's liberation, have you ever given any thought to legalizing homosexuality?"\n\nSvetlana blinked. She had always just ignored the concerns of the homosexuals - but maybe it was for the best if she finally took up the cause.\n\n"Sveta, are you there?"\n\n"Yes. I'm still here."

From afar, he made insights into people's lives - most would call it slander. Perhaps it was insensitive, but Alexei didn't see any harm in the matter. He blew into the whistle, and fifty people began to cross the street. The man in the fedora over there probably likes to play the harp. The woman in the red blazer likes her tea with milk for some strange reason. The two teen boys over there holding hands -\n\nWait a damn minute. They were holding hands. People could do that now? People lik- 'Focus on the job, Alexei. You're late to let the cars pass.' He told himself, blowing the whistle once more, gesturing to the drivers that they could go. Alexei continued working late into the afternoon, the thought of him holding hands with another comrade, until Antonina arrived to begin her shift. He made his way home, silently contemplating. He walked by a poster proclaiming 'COMRADES CAN LOVE WHO THEY LOVE' in bright red letters.\n\nTurning his head back, he thought that maybe he could.

Suffice to say that when our medical teams entered we found more to scrape off than to lift up - he had been fed through a grinder, apparently, and what was left was quite frankly immaterial in the literal sense.\n\nWhat I want you to know, Dinara, is this: it was not us. No matter what the radio says in the coming days or weeks, I know the Muslim community here. We have always had faith in God to preserve us - you know that we are not violent people. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nWhat we believe may soon be irrelevant, however. Already the Government has issued another of their foul Revolutionary Directives to begin 'investigations' into the death, and the neighbours of the flat I am staying in have been questioned several times in the last week. And there is more, too: they are actively removing those that still wear the veils. Yes, women are being accosted on the street for the crime of following what they believe. Is this the socialist culture we were told would set us free?\n\nIt is not safe for us here, not anymore, and I know that you are a loyal servant. You, too, will not long survive the Government's anger. Pack your suitcase, my love: we must flee from the cities until this latest transgression is forgotten.

It was nice to have a short period of time where she could breathe and reorient herself. In a way, wasn't that what she was doing with Russia? A calm, a reorganizing of efforts before pushing to the Pacific?\n\nShe chuckled, shaking her head. This was supposed to be a time where she didn't think about politics. She brushed those thoughts aside and continued onwards, allowing the cool breeze to blow on her. She took off her hat, feeling the wind flow through her hair. It felt nice, as she never was able to spend much time outside. It was almost as if the winds of change were blowing in her favor.\n\nShe had so much more left to do. The people of West Siberia had suffered greatly, and would have to be assisted by her government. There were so many social reforms she'd have to implement, as well. She nee- no.

After all, as a modern socialist country, we cannot allow over half of our population to be deprived of the rights they deserve.

While their parents would play a role in their upbringing, said upbringing would be collective, involving the entire community. This would prevent the parents from passing on bad traditions to their children, while also ensuring that the children get a well-rounded childhood. This would also mean that the family, as it exists now, would be phased out if this was the nationwide standard. Does that make sense to you?"\n\nDimitri mused it over. He understood the concept, and could see how it would be executed. "Yes, it makes sense to me. However, I can imagine that there would be those opposed to such an idea, along with the possible negative consequences.

Her reforms had borne fruit, and it seemed the [NIK.GetName] was stronger than ever. Man and woman stood as equals, and those of a different race were not oppressed anymore. Unlike so many other socialists, she had worked to ensure that these rights weren't in name only.

Radios are switched on, through the Republic's environs, and their volume turned all the way up as horrified ears take it all in.\n\nIt would probably have been easier to accept if the new regime offered concessions or promised a transition to a more permanent and just public order. Zhdanov, of course, promises with his trademark cheer that soon the citizens will return to a normality that favours the Republic as a whole.\n\nThe initial protests are unsettlingly loud and unnervingly close. Stations are barricaded or simply refuse to open, as do shophouses and public institutions. Police officers stationed in the district find themselves overwhelmed by the popular pressure, and a number of undercover police are nearly discovered and lynched by sheer force of popular anger. As it turns out, the broken clock of public anger does, in fact, strike twice a day.\n\nThis unnerves the covert agents of Special Circumstances. New plans are created in the dead of night, and networks once thought solid melt and coalesce in new configurations, like a shifting cloud forming around a dense maze. At the heart of this cloud are a group of seemingly random individuals. They will be the first test of the new Republic's socialist science.\n\nOn a Monday morning, as the not-protests roll into their fifth day, individuals begin to disappear from the protests, and when they return they speak as if they had never doubted the Republic - when they speak at all. The confusion they spread instead poisons the protests, rumors of internal disorder and violence stain its reputation, and by Wednesday order has returned, albeit in a less-than-satisfactory form."

The key was not to act smart - it was to have the people at your back. Better yet - to have the right people have your back.\n\nAnd so when Zhdanov called the impromptu Party meeting he focused not on speechwriting, but on table arrangements. Like a dollmaker playing very elaborate house games, he moved certain positions close to him, and the names of those who were less than enthusiastic about Ultravisionary Socialism a little away, and in his mind he constructed a careful model of applause, built and timed just right to give the illusion of omnipresence.\n\nBy the time the Party Congress was formally in session, it had already been rigged to hell - but no one noticed, of course.\n\nWhen the Party Secretary declared the merger of the offices of General Secretary and Premier, it seemed like a tidal wave of applause swept the room, and confused delegates rose to give applause to what seemed like the People's Will. Delegates carefully planted in key positions on the perimeter clapped louder than the rest - the loudspeakers packed under each table amplified that effect. As Zhdanov accepted the laurels of Paramount Leader with grace, not a single question was raised.\n\nAnd so, without ever lifting a finger in immodesty, Zhdanov stole the Congress, the Party, and the Federation - and from that moment, the march of Soviet History was attuned to an altogether different beat."

The goal of their new mission was to figure out a way for their society to become one that will be a model for all socialist countries. Ideas ranged from the idea of a united culture that would surround all socialist countries and would inspire many of them. However first, they would need to select what they would research first. Would they reach for the idea that they would need to research deep into the ideas of technology that would connect them such as satellites and high tech radio? Or would they delve deeper into fields such as sociology where they would learn how to truly influence people and make sure the society that they envisioned would be the best one for the people that would live in the society. Whatever focus they choose to look at first, it would be the one that would be important to the future of the socialist cause for visionaries everywhere."

 zhdanov.12.d:0 ""Comrades, I have assembled you all here today to discuss our tactics that the West Russian Revolutionary Front had used against the Nazis during the Great Patriotic War." Said Varennikov to the men that had been assembled in front of him. While many of them had fought in the war, some of them hadn't, and had been more focused on operating in the East during the conflict.\n\n"As many of us know too well, we had been too brash in our attacks, coming into Moscow with an incredible speed. While these tactics are seen as acceptable in some places, it truly led to our downfall" He stopped for a split section and watched the room, before motioning to an assistant to change the projector screen, it then showed a map of the Russian advance. Varennikov then pulled out a presentation pointer and tapped it against the border regions of Moscow. "While our first attacks had been good, they soon descended into a slow moving slaughter. We had caught the Germans off-guard. They thought that we had been dead for good, however as they learned over the next few months, it couldn't have been more wrong. They will certainly be expecting us to arrive to their doorstep in the coming years so we must learn from our mistakes"\n\nVarennikov motioned to the assistant once again, who had seemed to fall asleep. He poked the assistant with the pointer, who then shot up awake and changed the slide. It then showed a picture of Hans Spiedal, the man who had stopped the war.\n\n"This man right here, he is the architect of our downfall. If we must win against him, we must prepare.

Some of them preferred to be drinking a more heavy substance, one that would wake them up and prepare them for a day of discussing the next generations of warfare that they would develop and the armies would take place in. Many subjects had been brought up so far, such as the development of bombers that could strike from miles in the air and hit targets countries away.\n\nHowever, one of the more polarizing topics that had been brought up was the development of lasers. Lasers had been a personal interest of many of the scientists who had been assigned to work on the projects. However, they soon remembered that they had to focus on only the next generation and not fifty years now. Many of them shared the same ideas. The warfare in the coming decade would mostly be shaped as similar to the combat that many of them had seen so far. One that was fought and won with fast moving vehicles and a very mobile infantry. Some scientists had more outlying ideas that soon garnered more interest. One idea was proposed that the next generation of war would be completely fought with air combat. Land would be seen as irrelevant unless the helicopters or planes had been dropping off soldiers for a fast-strike mission, such as a raid. While the idea had certainly been seen as laughable at first, it soon garnered more attention as some of the men had begun to agree with it after thinking over the idea a few times. While certainly controversial, it was an opinion that could possibly work in due time. As the men filed out the building to continue their research, they wondered if it was truly possible at the end of the day."

 zhdanov.14.d:0 "Like the meeting the scientists had recently, it was another one focused on warfare of a certain generation. However, instead of focusing on the next decade that many of them would possibly be alive for, they now focused on 2070. The year was picked due to it being a whole century later, one that would be very focused on really seeing on how much the scientists could think of. As the scientists fired into the room, they saw the assignment that they needed to do, so they began to get to work.\n\nUnlike the previous discussion, many of the men did not go into camps to discuss their ideas. The whole exercise was one that was seen as a radical decision. It was one hundred years later, certainly something that none of the men would be alive for. Maybe some of their great grandchildren, but not them. Many of them had differing ideas, but many stuck to one or two ideas by the end of the day. The first idea being that the warfare in 2070 would be largely focused around the internal mind of soldiers, with them fighting in an environment that would be largely based upon the basis of "neuro-warfare" a concept that would be developed in the next century as a way to both train soldiers and as a tool for battle. The second idea was one that the wars of tomorrow would be fought with huge towering machines. Ones that would carry armaments that would destroy the armies of today within hours. While they would be extremely expensive, even a country having one would be a massive detriment from any attacks on them. Like the last meeting, when the time was up, the men filed out. However unlike the last one, many had felt much more inspired by this one, thinking that if it was truly possible to have our minds do the battle for us or even giant machines to fight."

In the coming days he had to decide a manufacturer that would produce all of the weapons that the Soviet Federation would use to take back Moscow. However he still needed to pick.\n\nOne of the options was a group that had been relatively unknown, known as Goran Arms. The company itself had been around for about ten years, and had produced weapons of good quality. They had been known for being on time, but with weapons that had been seen as basic to the times. On the other hand was the G.A. Korobov, a famous visionary that had made his name known with his weapon designs. While he had yet to put out a design, he had found favor with the many visionaries that found themselves home in the federation.\n\nAs Zhdanov read over the two profiles, it came soon apparent that he would need to choose. While he quite liked the companies both, he liked the visionary nature of Korobov. However he liked that Goran had produced weapons before that had been well received."

Some had taken unbelievably daring journeys over German lines to get there. Emma's story was significantly less impressive; she flew in from New York after some time as a student radical. She shared an apartment in the capital with a few other foreigners, and when the "Embassy of the Global Proletariat" was announced she was among the first to sign up.\n\nThe building was an old meeting hall, chosen for its scale, with different nations' delegations arranged in a great circle, and Emma decided to tour them before joining her comrades in the American section. First came the Soviet section, robustly populated with a number of local officials. Then came the British section, an eclectic collection of elderly resistance fighters and trade unionists. The German delegation piqued her interest. "Comrades, you must have suffered greatly under fascism. How did you escape?"\n\nThe man she was addressing looked confused before replying in what was unmistakably a local accent, "Ah, I see the confusion. In the absence of German representatives, we are portraying the German proletariat in their stead."\n\nStrolling the aisles from Hungary's, to Iran's, to, most bizarrely of all, the "oppressed African peoples'" delegations, Emma found that the case was the same. Without the global proletariat actually present, the Soviets had taken to casting Russians in their roles and instructing them to imagine what the people of those nations might support. While she appreciated the enthusiasm, perhaps it may have been better to leave this particular project on the drawing board."

For this reason, this letter is being written in [NIK.Capital.GetName] instead of Moscow, so long the heart of Russia - for this reason, millions suffer in the groans of an oppression so horrific it is almost unbelievable.\n\nFor this reason, while millions burned in East Europe, you defiled the surface of the Moon - an innocent celestial body which had done you no harm - with a flag steeped in the remains of those who have wanted nothing more than to resist you.\n\nWe understand, too, that your Masters wish to bend history, and have deluded themselves into believing they can control the future of the world by simply willing it into being with rifles and tanks. To this we have nothing to say, except the obligatory words of the sane to the madman: good luck! May you soon be disabused of this idea, and may its loss hurt you bitterly.\n\nBut we will make no bones about our own desires: what was stolen from the Workers of Russia, the Russian People cry out day and night to regain. The boots you use to stamp upon our people from old Kiev to old Leningrad will be consumed in fire as you are held aloft, the yoke turned inside out and twisted into a stabbing dagger. We will stop at nothing until our people are free.\n\nAnd on behalf of that part of the world that still calls itself free, we cordially invite you to take down the offending flags - and the armies that held them aloft - and leave at once, for Germania your home.

Not for the stunning architecture or natural beauty, mind you, although we do possess plenty of those once you get past the suburbs.

The history of socialism, in Russia as everywhere else, is steeped in the tears of betrayal and mutual recrimination. Were one to ask a worker in the streets of your average urban city anywhere around the world, he would call the Communist one who was more dedicated to fighting his contemporaries than his enemies! (Laughter, commotion.)\n\nThat disunity cost us dearly when our enemies came for us, as we had foretold so clearly. Indeed, we are the Cassandras of history: always warning of the catastrophes awaiting the Capitalist world and on guard against Fascism, and yet never able to protect ourselves from our predictions. Our squabbling kept us from mounting an effective resistance, here in Russia, and around the world the smoke of failed revolutions wafted countries even further into chaos than they had been at the start.\n\nNo more, comrades!

As the Federation had grown in complexity and size, so too had his administrative functions, until it seemed like half his job was scheduling meetings for the right people to meet each other and get things done for him.\n\nThe other half, however...Zhdanov smiled. The other half of his job made it all worth it.\n\nThe old dream he'd hidden was coming into view, in gluts of weekly reports from the scientists. The limits of the human mind were being stretched into new shapes and patterns; even where his ideas had failed, they had given so much information in the bargain that he couldn't say they'd been failures at all. Soon the New Socialist Man would rise like Titans from the deep, super-men ready to rebuild the shattered nation and bring Proletarian humanity to where they'd always dreamt of going: the stars.\n\nAnd the machines on which they would ride were coming into being, too - as the Testing Initiatives grew ever more expansive, their tests blossomed into fruition, too. Forget about the military applications, he'd always told the Generals. The wonder is enough. And the wonder Zhdanov experienced as he read about the test flights he couldn't watch personally was like - a man watching the summer stars, dreaming of taking flight. Yes, like a scene in a dream.\n\nNodding quietly, Zhdanov rummaged around his study and began a new series of scribblings in a well-worn leather notebook. Frowning, he scrapped the first draft he'd drawn and began a new one. This one was far more complex than the first; notes to self-referential articles abounded, and with them actual scientific reports, but in the centre were three clear and outlined words, circled repeatedly as with a child's drawing."

The realisation that Ultravisionary Socialism is destined to spread throughout the universe, as determined by Paramount Leader Andrei Zhdanov's intense study of the immortal science of Ultravisionary Socialism. Originally promulgated as a solution to the Fermi Paradox of Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, which observes the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence of extraterrestrial life and the immense likelihood of its existence, Paramount Leader Zhdanov discovered that the most likely block to the advancement of extraterrestrial life to the interplanetary and intersolar stages of development was the persistence of backward stages of development (feudalism, capitalism, fascism) on alien worlds.\n\nWith the immortal science of Ultravisonary Socialism only existing on Earth, brought to us by the unique genius of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Zhdanov, only Earth holds the possibility of rising to a higher stage of interplanetary, intersolar, and perhaps even intergalactic development. It is thus the duty of the Soviet Federation, as one true embodiment of Ultravisionary Socialism, to spread itself first across the Earth, and then to alien worlds suffering under the oppression of primitive barbarism.\n\nTHE INTERSOLAR SOVIET FEDERATION. A future space-faring intersolar civilization founded on the principles of Ultravisionary Socialism, as vaticinated by Paramount Leader Andrei Zhdanov. Starting on Earth, the Intersolar Soviet Federation will spread from planet to planet, liberating alien species from the oppression of feudalism, capitalism, and fascism. Its armed forces, the Intersolar Red Armada, will obliterate all enemies in its path, assisting extraterrestrial workers and peasants in their struggle against their oppressors. It will educate the alien workers in the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Zhdanov, and ingrain in them a deep understanding of the immortal science of Ultravisionary Socialism. Ultimately, the Intersolar Soviet Federation is destined to expand throughout the universe, ushering in a final, Universal Soviet Federation, and an eternal aeon of universal peace, prosperity, and liberty."

Listening in on people for the Commissariat gave him a sense of connection to people he felt he would otherwise never have, even if they were total strangers.\n\nSome he even grew attached to. One old man, a retired violinist, routinely played his instrument in his small apartment on the third floor of the complex. He was of little interest in terms of scientific observation, yet Volkov still listened in almost every day, and came to love and depend on the old man's little personal recitals. When the old man finally died, Volkov felt the loss deeply. He even broke protocol and attended the old man's funeral from a distance, leaving flowers at his grave after his family and friends had departed.\n\nAnother subject Volkov grew close to was a florist who lived in one of the second floor apartments. He grew to love the sound of her voice, on the phone to her mother, or drinking with a friend, or just talking to her flowers, which she treated with great care and fondness. Volkov wrote down her every idle move, the notes then fed back to the scientists for analysis. Yet one day, while hosting a party at her house, Volkov caught her disparaging Paramount Leader Zhdanov, calling him a "unhinged lunatic." Volkov felt great mental anguish over this incident.\n\nOf course, he ultimately turned her in.

One.\n\nA column of smoke erupted from the platform, and the mighty engines of the great metal beast roared to life, and it sailed upon that column into the crystal blue sky.. And Zhdanov wondered, as he had on many a sleepless night, what awaited a species freed from the chains of gravity, free to roam the galaxy?

In any case, he was on a mission. Young Michal had disappeared, precisely two weeks to the day, and Pyotr wondered if he'd been adopted by someone. If the Master didn't tell him what was up, he'd find out himself!\n\nIt had been ten minutes since the last adult entered. By Pyotr's reckoning this was the time when the adults gathered. He began to move, barely ever touching the ground with his feet. Bound by silent bound he covered the space to the main lobby, where he'd heard the adults gather. His eyes grew wide as he approached the window. The harsh industrial lights were on, and he heard urgent talking from beyond the glass pane. A meeting, perhaps?\n\nLeaning in, he heard the muffled words: "...will compensate you for the human losses, Kryushkov."\n\n"You must be mad. Two weeks from the last 'retrieval' and you must take another child? What on earth are you doing to them?" The Master's voice had something...different to it. It sounded reedy, almost pained. Was he in mourning?\n\n"We are building the Revolution. Young children, too, must serve this goal. Now, please, step aside - I do not want to make this messy. Oh, and they are all illiterate, are they not? " Silence. "Very well. We will teach them with the words of Marx." The door swung open, catching Pyotr in the floodlights of the yard. A thick-waisted man with a false smile leaned down towards him, his eyes gleaming like the magpies they often saw in the yard.\n\n"Hello, little boy. How would you like to serve the Socialist Paradise?" Pyotr, tongue-tied, only stared. In an instant the man's gaze turned to coldness and he nodded to the darkness outside. "Take this one. We will train him to agree, too."\n\nAs black-gloved hands dragged him away from the Factory, Pyotr heard beyond the sounds of his own cries the faint sobbing of the Master, echoing in the expanse of the lobby like a bird's call."

Of note are:\n\nSubject 3: Administered XXXX gas through ventilation in the evening, observed the following day.\nDaily triggers included: Loud tapping across the walls; noise replicated from war-era Stuka dive bombers for fifteen (15) minutes every six (6) hour period; a list of phrases read aloud (see list on page 58); a recital of the Communist Manifesto with alternating narrators.\nResult: Subject did not exhibit any abnormalities in mental or physical functioning for three (3) days. On the fourth (4) day, subject collapsed during lunch in their cell and experienced a heart attack. This test was replicated on 2 more subjects to no results. Original subject expired on XX/XX/XX.\n\nSubject 8: Experiment began with the subject being placed into lab chair XXXX (X), observed by four (4) scientists.

Post-recovery questioning revealed that the subject was incapable of performing violent acts, nor could they even fully grasp the concept of 'violence'.\n\nConclusion: I advise that we switch objectives. Neither subject came close to long-term trigger response necessary for the 'Sleeper Agent Theory'. However, both subjects proved that there is much more to the human brain that we are unaware of. We should replicate Subject 8's experiment on a wider test group.

Brotherhoods of humanity, wielding their collective knowledge to construct a future unimaginable to the average man of today.

Groups initiated combat over which rooms they thought gave them more privacy (the library's bookshelf area experienced many brawls), and some loners tried to escape the facility by hitting the glass walls (to no avail).\n-By the end of final month, twenty (20) subjects had been slain, and thirty two (32) were severely injured. Eight (8) loners had slipped into madness.\nConclusion: The experiment cost us many resources to set up, but ultimately disproved existing hypotheses. After its conclusion, an interview revealed that most subjects were in a mentally traumatized state. However, we were able to draw a little bit of data regarding human interaction.\nPost-Test: The remaining subjects have been transferred back to the GULAG system. However, after one (1) week, they had been reorganized back into their 'cliques' as they were no longer able to function without other members of their group.

The entirety of the compound was equipped with speaker systems.\nBy week six (6), all subjects had experienced the phrases and elected to stick together. By your authorization on XX/XX/XX, we began playing the white noise and subliminal messages even when the subjects were in groups. By the final month, the program would play nearly every day, up to four hours a day.\nResult: At first, the subjects refused to comply with the messages, so we toned down the requests. By week eight (8) we were no longer requesting actions, but rather filtering in phrases from the propagandist's office. After the experiment's conclusion, the subjects were questioned.

Since you have certainly passed the accuracy tests, I believe it is about time to transition to the simulation tests, don't you agree?' said the engineer standing behind the soldier. He looked especially smug about receiving praise from Turgenev, who had harshly criticized many of his previous designs.\n\n'Yeah, sure. Hopefully it doesn't snap when I get off the helicopter.

It has performed as expected in airborne drop scenarios, and has been proven to be functional as an infantry weapon. Comrade Afanasyev has managed to reduce the inaccuracy caused by the rifle's unique characteristics down to a margin of 5%. Soldiers testing the weapon report its unusually light weight as a major boon, and some officers have already requested the Tarakan prototype rifle, official name pending, for use in airborne operations.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nProject Tarakan has proven to be a success, and Comrade Afanasyev's design meets all requirements necessary for production authorization.

Your. Shitty. Rifle,' with that said, Turgenev walked away from the firing range, the engineer too afraid to continue the argument.\n\nPROJECT TARAKAN - TEST 41 RESULTS:\nComrade Asfanasyev's 'bullpup' design has faced numerous problems during its development. The chief issue being its long-range accuracy. The extremely short barrel and extremely light weight have a tendency to drastically reduce the accuracy of those using the rifle. Test 41 concluded when the soldier testing the rifle, Sargeant Sergei Turgenev, grew frustrated with the rifle's inaccuracy and exited the firing range. Sergeant Sergei Turgenev received a brief reprimand for his poor behavior, but is expected to return to normal duty within the week.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe Tarakan prototype rifle has failed to meet any accuracy standards required for production, and development of the rifle is growing too expensive to justify the rifle's somewhat niche purpose. As such, it is recommended that Comrade Asfanasyev's project be defunded, and for him to be returned to his position within the Soviet Instrument Design Bureau."

Similarly, the laser wiped out a radar system without harming the dog sitting next to it, and the Szhatie prototype effectively tracked and disable three aircraft, forcing their pilots to bail. It was surprisingly silent too, a small buzzing sound that was easily drowned out by the sound of the generator's roar. The prototype had surpassed all expectations he had had for it, and the scientist next to him kept rambling on and on about the many scientific miracles that went into building it. Clearly he was proud of his work.\n\n'So, Comrade Aslanov, how much would it cost to make more of these miraculous weapons? They've clearly proven their effectiveness,' The general expected some long-winded response from the overly talkative scientist, but instead he went deathly pale and went silent. That couldn't be a good sign.\n\nPROJECT SZHATIE RESULTS: Partial Success\n\nCONCLUSION: While the Project Szhatie prototype exceeded all expectations, and passed all tests with flying colors. The officer overseeing the tests initially advocated for further production, until learning of the costs. The artificial rubies used to focus the laser are prohibitively expensive, and drastically raise the cost of production. This alone makes Project Szhatie unfeasible for mass-production, however the design is also limited by its massive power requirements, which likewise raise the design's cost.

The variable sweep wings have proven to be highly effective in their role, allowing the bomber to use a much shorter runway for takeoff and avoid the danger of stalls at high speeds. The bomber is planned to be capable of carrying both heavy cruise missiles for standard targets and lighter rocket pods for softer targets.\n\nPerformance-wise, the bomber has met all parameters expected, surpassing Mach 3 and having a service ceiling of 12,000 meters, high enough to evade German interceptors and anti-aircraft weapons. Avionics data suggests that the expected loadout will be well within its capabilities. The cost of developing such an aircraft has been extensive, as more than six hundred patents have been filed based on this project alone, but as production scales we will find more efficient methods of producing the necessary parts.

CHEREPAKHA solves a number of problems those vehicles suffered from, particularly the unreliability of the drive train and excessive fuel consumption, and overall is able to maintain a higher level of performance for longer.\n\nHowever, a number of other problems have emerged as a result of our solutions to the original problems. The lead lining of the crew compartment, the four-track drive train, and the unusual disc shape have resulted in the need for us to establish a completely new production line at the Izhevsk plant to create the prototype. Maintenance has also been an issue, as access to the mechanical portions of the tank is limited due to the design of the tank, and makes field repairs effectively impossible.\n\nIn spite of these difficulties, the vehicle has performed quite well in trials run by our personnel and demonstrations run for our military procurement officials, proving highly resistant to artillery fire and to rarely break down.

The rifle can also be fired ambidextrously since the cartridges are ejected behind the magazine. The rifle's rate of fire meets projected expectations, approximately 3 times faster than our currently equipped Kalashnikov rifles, and is chambered in the same 7.62x39 caliber.\n\nThe primary issues encountered in testing resulted from increased recoil, due to the greater amount of propellant used in each pull of the trigger. The rifle is also heavier than our current standard-issue rifles, and presents a considerable logistical challenge by expending three times as much ammunition as a standard Kalashnikov.\n\nHowever, if these logistical issues can be overcome, the rifle will serve as an excellent front-line infantry weapon.

After some failed experiments with caseless ammunition they have settled on the 7.62x39mm round used in Kalashnikov's automatic rifles, which should allow us to integrate it into our supply chain with relative ease.\n\nIncreased recoil has led us to recommend the addition of a bipod and an increase in the size of the weapon to allow the inclusion of a more robust feed system. Once this is completed, we will be able to put this weapon into production as a functional heavy support rifle. The increased rate of fire allows it to properly fulfill its role without consuming too much ammunition, and the jamming rate will be significantly reduced by the time we begin the manufacturing process.\n\nThe weight of the weapon makes it prohibitively heavy to issue as a standard infantry rifle, but it is lighter than most of our machine guns, and the use of a magazine instead of a belt makes it simple for any soldier trained in operating a Kalashnikov to use.

Our Soviet sisters are not to be treated as mindless cattle or neglected like the capitalist West, but to take an equal position alongside the men of the Soviet Union."\n\n"In the dark, desperate days of the fascist invasion, and then our war of liberation under the West Russian Revolutionary Front, women served in the factories, the fields, and the fighting to preserve our glorious nation, and in spite of every effort by the German fascists to grind us into dust, we are still here.

As they settled in and whispered into the microphones, the host greeted them and asked about their journey northwards, to which they responded with horrific stories of the freezing cold and the escape from bandits and murderers.\n\nEventually, the host came to the topic of the socialist cause in Russia, and what it meant to the guest. He remained silent for a moment, thinking about the question, before answering with bold and proud statements of admiration, confessing that even after living under brutal fascist indoctrination, we remained true to the teachings of Marx and Lenin. Furthermore, he detailed that many in Samara believed similar things, but were not so fortunate to escape from the grips of the fascist bandit regime.\n\nAs the interview concluded, the radio host thanked his guest and asked if he had any final words for the people living in western Russia. He cleared his throat and replied in his timid voice, urging the people to remain vigilant to the red torch of socialism, even when living in the most vile and brutal conditions, as the liberating march of the Red Army will rescue them soon as they rescued him.

It was no use. He needed a drink before he'd make any progress tonight. Arvids pushed back his chair and made his way for the kitchen. It wasn't a long journey, from one side of his apartment to the other, but it felt liberating just to be away from the desk. The downside was, however, he'd have to walk past him.\n\nThe portrait of Mikhail Suslov watched him as he made his way to his cabinet and retrieved his drink of choice. "Slacking on the job?" The portrait asked. "I should expect nothing less from you, Comrade Pelshe." Arvids shook the thoughts from his head. It was going to be alright, even if the reports were less than stellar, it wasn't damning. It meant there was room for improvement and Comrade Suslov ate up talk of improving, especially if it adheres to orthodox methods. Best of both worlds he'd say.\n\nArvids hobbled back to his desk, the papers strewn across his desk, hanging from the walls, dripping out from the clouds above, he inhaled reports and exhaled them back out.

What Arvids enjoyed more than putting his knowledge into practice was sharing it with just about anybody who would listen.\n\nSpeaking at the Syktyvkar Academy of State Service and Administration, Comrade Pelshe fell into his stride near immediately, speaking at length about the superiority of the socialist system employed by Comrade Suslov. What the economist didn't account for was for someone to talk back. Such is natural living day to day as and with yes men.\n\n"Comrade Pelshe," asked one of the pupils, "Should we not adhere to the foundation laid down by Comrade Buhkarin? I understand his shortcomings were plenty but at the same time, he led the charge to revitalize Siberia. A project, as we can see from what little news trickles in from the east, has bared fruit"\n\nArvids tightened his grip on the podium, his knuckles turning white, "I will capitulate to you on that point. Comrade Bukharin made great strides in breathing life into the dead east. However, I should not have to remind you where we are and how we ended up not in the Soviet Union of old, but in this new one. It is simply a matter of sustainability. Long term vs short term.

If he was honest with himself, he didn't know. But he was a member of the Communist party precisely for that reason.

Yet he did his work well, tried to take satisfaction in it when orders from the parties higher ups came down.\n\nRight now for instance, he'd been delegated to grant a series of awards to high performing members of the peasantry, mostly for services to socialism and the like. Apparently the party leadership was trying to emphasise their contributions to the survival of true communism or something. Talgat didn't really care, he had a job to do.\n\nThe people standing in the uneven line to his side, facing the cameras were an odd bunch. A mix of young women and elderly men for the most part, many stoney faced and scarred by years of hard labour in service of what they believed in. A young boy as well, apparently he'd single handedly stopped a fire which nearly reached a grain silo. As Talgat handed the boy his medal, he gave him a slight pat on the shoulder and assured him that the Party was proud of what he'd done. The sight of the smiling boy with his burn scarred face wouldn't visit Talgat in his dreams that night. But when he awoke he made sure to write a note to the Party higher ups to put him on the fast track for promotion within the party when he came of age anyway."

Main reason why monetary reform even started is to make ruble viable for outside trade, and in order to do this it should be as stable as it possibly can. Oldest method in economics book is to peg the currency to our gold reserves, which are scarce, but it should be enough to stabilize the prices. Next step is to establish a fixed exchange rate, mainly to avoid possible machinations and prevent inflation that it may cause. It was near midnight, but something didn't let Pelshe to fall asleep. Will his efforts to strengthen the ruble worth it? In the end money will lose all it's value, as Soviet industry grows more organized the more people will recognize money as what it is: a paper with ink on it.\n\nNo. In fifty years or so it will become a reality, he was sure about that, but right now there's no means to ensure the safe transition to moneyless society.

It was their own private little space away from the commotion of the classes to work on their greatest assignment yet; to study the ideas and explore the thoughts of the revolutionary father of Russia, Vladimir Lenin.\n\nFor young Kliment though, it was a slog. A constant, endless slog of reading dozens of long, winding tomes going on and on about the roles of the vanguard party, the establishment of the proletariats' dictatorship, etcetera etcetera. Most exhausting of all though was the man himself. From his birth in Simbirsk to his life in Saint Petersburg to his many imprisonments and his advocation for a continent wide revolution in the First World War... At least the October Revolution was coming up soon in their studies, so he could read up on a bit of action.\n\nThere were two reasons driving Kliment to stay diligent in his studies and not slack off, the first being his friends. They were into communism far more than he was and they were much more invested into this assignment, but they made Kliment laugh, they goofed around with him, they played pranks on each other, but most of all, they made him feel whole. And when school ended and he said his brief goodbyes to them 'til the next day, he'd have only one thing on his mind.\n\nIndeed, the young teen cared little for the old Bolshevik, and yet he was the greatest reason he worked so hard in his studies. His family was one marred by strife; from a father struck down by the Germans in the western war, to cousins and old family friends torn away during their conquest, in the end he was left with only a drunken uncle, traumatized by loss. He'd return only to find a sobbing mess on the couch, who'd immediately embrace him once he stepped inside. His uncle had turned to the ideals of Lenin when all else was lost to him; all else but Kliment. When his uncle learned he was now studying the man himself, his joy at the news was the first time Kliment could remember him truly being happy.

Out of almost a hundred applicants, Roman was one of the first - a technical school for him was a chance - to improve himself, to help his family and his country.\n\n"Most of you don't know how it works or about its place in a factory. But that's the reason why you come here, right? So, let's start with the basics."\n\nRoman's hand got tired after writing all the functions of a lathe, main elements of it, and many more to his notebook. That machine looked like something out of this world, a centerpiece of a song of steel and fire. And their teacher said that a factory in Plesetsk has dozen of machines just like that!

The room was buzzing with excitement and potential as Semyonov took the stage.\n\n"First of all, I'd like to thank you all for coming here. Even your presence shows how far we have come as a people. My generation had hardships of our own, but for you, who never knew a Russia that was not at war, to have achieved so much with all that was against you is truly remarkable. Your generation, the chemists and engineers, writers and artists, scientists and scholars in so many other fields, will be the ones who bring the Soviet people back onto the world stage with aplomb. My generation was unable to keep the Union together. Yours will make it the pride of the entire world, so long as you keep working and striving to be better than the day before."\n\nSemyonov went on for slightly under an hour, constantly having to ask the audience to restrain their applause.

Production and industry led Russia through a modern kind of warfare, and collectivization freed the peasants and the poor of Russia.\n\nAnd yet, Suslov knew there was still a long way to go. The Siberian government stands in the way of revolution and true communism, oppressing the workers and farmers alike. Meanwhile, the Germans sit waiting in Europe, murdering and enslaving those who oppose them.

Lately, his subject of attention had been on past failings of his Communist comrades during the last days of Bukharin's Soviet Union, a time of factionalism. The cold faced man had been wondering whom could be blamed for such discord incited failings?\n\nMikhail Suslov had been going over names: Lazar Kaganovich, Leon Trotsky, Vyacheslav Molotov. All of them had been personally involved themselves into factionalism, through backing a candidate for the post of General Secretary of the Soviet Union, backing themselves or instigated conflict in a dire period of history for the Union and its people: Trotsky had been part of the friction in the Union's early years after Lenin's death, having lusted to become General Secretary before ultimately losing to Bukharin, while Kaganovich and Molotov had been loyal lapdogs of Stalin in his own quest for the Soviet throne, though Suslov would've dismissed his name from the list if not for being an influenceable member of the party, susceptible to outside influences and merely those that his wife were sympathetic to.\n\nA slow realisation came to burgeon in his mind as the man continued to write, words flowing from the tips of his fingers.\n\n"Even if our party today is united and undivisible, it'd be foolish to say that it had always been the case. It has come to my attention that the actions of past members such as Kaganovich, Trotsky and Molotov might've been due to outside influences contrary to Lenin's ideals.\n\nOne would describle them as akin to cosmopolitan bankers, showing themselves to be prisonners of bourgeois Zionist ideology, a characteristic shared by rootless cosmopolites abroad. As evident by the subversive, anti-Soviet behavior of Kaganovich, Trotsky, and Molotov, ties to Zionist elements betrays a tendency to be beheld to capitalist foreign associations.""

After a couple of minutes, the group of communists finally found themselves in a poorly lit room, the elder man seemingly finding it difficult to find the lightswitch. Finally, after fumbling for what seemed like an eternity, lights were turned on and something instantly drawn Mikhail's attention: huge metal shelves closely knitted together, a layers of buttons running across the lot of them, electronics littering its facade.\n\n"A true state of the art work. Well, technically the first and only one of its kind here. Pure Soviet design and conception. Its complex capabilities shall surely be a boon to our administration matters, perhaps even a boon in other state matters."\n\nHe was shyly scrutinizing Suslov's face, trying to see a hint of emotion that could betray the cold facade he put up in front of others. Yet, the General Secretary stood there, cold faced as ever, contemplating what this breakthrough meant for the party, its bureaucracy, its future."

But Suslov remained human in spite of the image he tried to uphold, one that couldn't help but find himself wondering if his efforts in bringing the Soviet Union, one being run by democratic collective rule, will ever prove successful or if he'll fail like so many others before him: a footnote in history."

But the workload was too big, especially considering he was working 60 hour weeks to begin with.\n\nNikolai blinked, and suddenly an image of Zhdanov's smiling face popped into his mind. He shuttered, shoving it out as fast as it appeared. He leaned back in his chair, remembering the past couple months of his life.\n\nIt all seemed good, at first. Zhdanov, the Paramount Leader, offered him work on the new space program. Nikolai, a space lover since his childhood in Moscow, took him on the offer. Such a simple time. Then, he heard the rumors. Then the rumors became experiences, and experiences became nightmares as he was assigned to different projects, all somehow related to 'socialist utopian'.\n\nAnd he had done nothing but nod along, sign papers, and do everything to lay low. Sometimes, in the dead of night, when the only light that Nikolai had the pleasure of seeing was the swaying bulb in his bedroom or in the cubicles of the departments in whatever new building he was shuffled into, Nikolai wondered whether he was just as monstrous as Zhdanov, the man who signed off on every damnable experiment he had the displeasure of witnessing. Other times, Nikolai wondered whether his actions would do anything in the first place. Would his mother and father, those old revolutionaries, have been proud of him?\n\nIt didn't matter.

But, if she were to be asked about any of the myriad and fantastical scientific initiatives undertaken by the Federation's government, she could have offered little insight.\n\nSuch a response would have puzzled many, and led to a subset of the same questioning how she could therefore even call herself an Ultravisionary. Her response? That while Zhdanov and the others looked to the stars, she looked to the minds, faces, and identities of the millions of the people in the Federation.\n\nShe was one of, and certainly the most prominent, social ultravisionaries within the faction, focused on achieving radical and revolutionary leaps in progress of the population's social order. Methods of thought, tenets of instruction, particularities of language and, yes, even the very names people were given were all concepts that she intended to change. Change for the better.\n\nFurtseva knew that her social proposals and pursuits were deemed as less important than the scientific ones, but she also knew that while achievements in space would be limited to the few, achievements in the Federation's - and eventually the world's - social order would be transformational to the many, and she was prepared to work to achieve that dream.\n\nWhich made her position as the Federation's Foreign Minister so valuable. Zhdanov and the others might have thought relatively little about dealings with the outside world, but she saw it as an opportunity to prepare the ground - worldwide - for growth.\n\nGrowth that she would one day see achieved."

What she actually thought mattered little.\n\nWhich meant a lot of 'polite conversations' and 'nice dinners' with other politicians who chased after her, more interested in her biology than her position. But is she could not avoid such pursuits, she could at least exploit them. She could promise to help the man, knowing full well that Shepilov would defeat the initiative on his own, and in turn gain his vote for one of her upcoming social proposals. A nice victory, she thought.\n\nAnd, so, she maintained her polite smile. The screaming had ended."

Her attention was drawn back to events when Zhdanov began pontificating about how the support of the people, of the no-doubt visionaries among the Federation's millions of ordinary citizens, was critical to the Presidium's efforts in securing technological dominance.\n\nAt first she had ignored the line. And then it was if she had been struck by lightning. So powerful was the moment that her mask cracked, if only for a second, and even then drawing several interested stares.\n\nShe had been struggling so hard to gain support from the scientists for initiatives in support of the socialist superculture that she knew was critical to create. But all she had to do was explain to them that a true socialist culture, united in visionary thought, could not but expend every effort, dedicate every joule in their being, towards the achievement of scientific greatness.\n\nThe scientists were empirical men, procedural men, and they implicitly accepted as fact that proper support and infrastructure was critical to the success of any experiment or feat of engineering. If she could only convey that proper social culture was just as important as the right carbon content of steel or the correct amperage of an applied current, then she could all but guarantee support.\n\nFurtseva allowed herself a small smile.

It seemed a mad proposition.\n\nBut both of them knew very well that when Andrei Zhdanov proposed something considered visionary, it could not be ignored. And so, together with Zhdanov himself, they worked late into the night. As they did, however, they could not but grow entranced by the idea. By how many problems it solved. By the radical transformation it would no doubt catalyze at all levels of society.\n\nImagine! A currency eternally backed by a local commodity, a commodity universally applicable! Workpower liberated towards positive communal uses! Freedom from the corrupting forces of speculation and manipulation!\n\nEven apart from the ideals the men could conceptualize, the direct benefits could not be overstated either. If currency was connected to energy, then as national energy output increased so too did currency supply, but absent inflationary practices. And, if such a scheme was introduced, the work of the state's planning organs could be immensely simplified, as citizen rations could be determined through a simple allocation of energy, rather than as a basket of goods.\n\nThere would be problems, yes, but what true visionary could disagree with what was offered? Or shrink from the challenge to what countless will surely say cannot be done? Not they, and so once the proposal was complete,, Zhdanov ordered that it be introduced in the Presidium as soon as possible.\n\nHe, and they, could not wait to get started."

Zhdanov spoke, passionately and at length, about the many positives. But he ignored one critical problem: that to do so would immediately destroy any and all of the hard-won confidence in the ruble, as well as rendering foreign exchange impossible besides. And the Federation was not prepared for the imposition of effective autarky.\n\nIn desperation, Shepilov looked to the voices he knew to be rational - those of Nikolai Kardashev and Yekaterina Furtseva - and to his immense relief found them to be equally as horrified as himself. Exchanging slight nods of support, they prepared themselves for yet another careful repudiation of a 'visionary' initiative.\n\nWhen the debate and vote later came, they managed to successfully argue for the 'delay' of the 'excellent' idea, 'until such time as the entirety of the motherland could be liberated from occupying forces.'\n\nShepilov knew that the issue would return in the future.

The 'visionary' initiatives proposed by Zhdanov himself, or by his adherents if permitted were, to a one, utterly insane on a national scale, and nobody but himself and vanishingly few others seemed to realize this.\n\nConcepts that should have existed only in university laboratories, that should only have received small grants, if any at all, were suddenly introduced at the Presidium, assigned national priority, and allocated billions of rubles. The criteria for which often could be traced back to 'because the Paramount Leader had a visionary idea.'\n\nIt was no way to run a small business, let alone a recovering great power like Russia, and Shepilov often felt like the only man willing to say so. The one saving grace, the one thing he gave thanks for, was the discretion his position gave him. As the man ultimately in charge of implementing financial policy he could, as much as possible, rein in spending when Zhdanov and his clique were not looking. Which, given their focus on devising new 'visionary' efforts, was often.\n\nHe only hoped he could continue to do so, and find some allies besides.

For every insane project he tempered, another was proposed. For every microwave cannon he delayed, a semiballistic transport aircraft was put into development. It never stopped. It was as if Zhdanov and his cohorts never slept.\n\nAnd the results, presented by the ledgers, were clear. Every time they were updated, reserves had decreased, the degree of deficit spending had increased, and creditors were willing to extend fewer and fewer resources. There was simply no way to reconcile the Federation's budget in order to support such 'visionary' initiatives while also ensuring basic civilian services in a nation still bearing the scars of decades of civil war.\n\nBut, try as he might, he could not build enough support in the Presidium to act as a proper counterbalance. Kardashev and Furtseva would back him, sometimes, but they had their own positions and goals to think about, and even together they could not entirely block a proposal. They could merely postpone. And he could not even act in such a way very often, if he wanted to keep his position at all.\n\nSoon, Shepilov knew, looking at the ledgers, the columns of which were written entirely in red ink, a threshold would be reached, and all his skill would not be enough to save the Federation.

An explorer of a period that would, in time, come to be known as one of abject recklessness. Of abject foolishness. Of, perhaps, abject insanity.\n\nHaving personally approved the funding of the campus, after expending his political capital in preventing a proposal for bullet train bridges from the Kola to Kanin Peninsulas, he knew that the resources spent on it could have otherwise allowed for significant increases in agricultural production in Central Siberia. On a project that could actually benefit the state in concrete fashion, both in the near- and long-term.\n\nBut that proposal had not been 'visionary' enough, and this one had. After all, without this complex, he remembered Chelomei proclaiming with absolute surety, how could they ever produce enough electroconductive fluid to permit exoplanetary mining operations?\n\nAs the director continued speaking at him, Shepilov turned to look at the buildings, ignoring the words. Would he, in time, revisit this place as a monument to works once thought 'great,' to those who thought ultravisionary projects an example of the might of the Federation?\n\nShepilov did not know.

He had expected a quiet setting, but as he had approached the room he could hear multiple voices speaking. So, with a huff, he listened at the door like an eavesdropper. It seemed people were being briefed on his theory.\n\n"Effectively, there are three levels of civilization. Planetary, Stellar and Galactic, each defined by the resident society's control over their energy. Type I civilizations hold the ability to use and store all of their planet's energy. Type II civilizations do the same with their solar system. Type III do the same with the galaxy. We, of course, are not at any of these, but as the he has said, we may yet be one day. What makes this man a true visionary is he believes we can become a Planetary Civilization through socialism and cultural unity."\n\nNikolai tensed up as he heard a gentle murmur of approval and discussion. Rising to his full height and bracing himself, Nikolai opened the door to find a small group of men gathered around a table, with Zhdanov himself at the head. Each of them had a copy of two of his recent papers in their hands with annotations scrawled over them. "There he is! Gentleman, this is Nikolai Kardashev.

He was also, as Kardashev now knew, a man whose ideals were actively dangerous, not only to the space program, but for the Federation as a whole.\n\nWhile Kardashev had proposed reasonable exploration, the leveraging of zero-gravity environments for research, and a general program of safety and sustainability, Chelomei had almost immediately dismissed it. He, and the Paramount Leader as well, wanted nothing but the most ambitious projects possible.\n\nEnormous capsules and stations. Heavy-lift rockets using the most dangerous and unstable of fuel mixtures. Military applications. Not only was such a course indefensibly reckless, Kardashev knew, but it was also wholly unsustainable in terms of resources - human, financial, and otherwise.\n\nEven so, Kardashev thought upon reflection, what was he to do about it?

At that, Kardashev had fought back.\n\nHe wanted to see careful progress made in fundamental advances before any end-stage initiatives could be realized.

Even as she turned her head to break the law one more time that night, each action was entered into her trained mental litany.\n\nThe woman, of course, was a member of the Directorate for the Investigation of Special Circumstances, a star agent of the United Soviet Federation's infamous spy agency.

Perhaps, some thought, it was a scientific proposal that he couldn't wait to shove down their throats, knowing his status as Zhdanov's successor made him immune to normal parliamentary procedures. Others, more paranoid, feared it was the beginning of a round of purges, to prepare the way for Kurchatov's eventual takeover.\n\nAs it happened, neither of those possibilities happened.\n\n"Comrades," he began, his voice trembling a little, "I regret to inform you that I will be retiring from public life as soon as I am free to do so."\n\nThe room collectively held its breath, as he continued, stating that his age made his position as Vice Premier a "burden" and that "a newer, younger generation" would best be sought to replace him in six month's time, his official retirement date. What double entendres occurred were obvious, as Zhdanov, sitting right beside him, looked nervously at the members of the Presidium.\n\nWhen Kurchatov finished, he was greeted with applause from the Presidium and Zhdanov. The chamber even passed a resolution with debate thanking him for his service to his countryman and to the worker's movement.

A portent had been simultaneously observed and understood.\n\nAnd, just as quickly, it was answered. Kurchatov announced to the two men that he would, in the very near future, be announcing his retirement. The time had come for change, he had said, both for the Federation and for himself, and he had no intention of overstaying his welcome.\n\nBoth Kardashev and Chelomei immediately understood the situation and their own place within it, as both saw their opportunity to replace Kurchatov and thereby increase their influence over the Federation's direction. It would be a difficult case to make, indeed, but the reward was well worth it.\n\nWorking hard not to betray their intentions to the other, or to Kurchatov himself, the two men offered their support for their superior's decision as well as their thanks for his long and successful service, and departed soon after. Once out of sight, however, they began to move with increased speed.\n\nThe race was on. For the position itself, of course, but also for securing the political support needed to obtain it."

Back into his office at the People's Commissariat of Defense he strutted; giving nods to officers and staffers as he sat at his seat.\n\nThe race was on; and he'd need to get as much support as he could- Furtseva, Varennikov and Zhdanov himself were easy support- the committees could bend his way, and even Semichastny's enigmatic Special Circumstances Directorate could probably be reasoned with; leaving it an easy climb... unless Kardashev could steal his support. The Old Reformers had to be silenced, his position had to be solidified...\n\nWhat seemed like an easy cakewalk was becoming more and more of a challenge; much to his annoyance.

Unless he could somehow convince Zhdanov, the committees... A pause, as he sprinted towards his office at the People's Commissariat of Energy, taking names. Numbers. The intelligence services. Old Reformers. Oplesnin. The People's Commissar of Industry- and he'd have to convince several of them. Vladmir Chelomei was charismatic and suave- yet abrasive and self assured.

But the time had come to hand over the reins, and enjoy a retirement long deserved.\n\nKurchatov had seen the looks in both Kardashev and Chelomei's eyes when he had told them of his decision. It was, after all, why he had summoned them. Both had seen a chance to replace him, and he was sure that, even now, they were frantically moving to secure support. It would be a most interesting competition to watch, especially since he did not particularly care about the outcome.\n\nBoth men, despite their vastly different outlooks, were visionaries.

Kardashev nodded, sweat forming on his brow from the heat of the projector and his own nerves.\n\n"What I am most pleased to present to you, Comrade Zhdanov, is the potential for a fusion-based fuel economy.

Do not concern yourself overmuch with matters of state, but know that your project will come to rest in capable hands.

Vladimir Chelomei, a lurker in the halls of power, had apparently been secreted away with Comrade Zhdanov in unofficial meetings. The implications of this were less than stellar for Kardashev: he likely no longer had Zhdanov's ear in the succession matter.\n\nKardashev slid back into his chair, absently rubbing his race.

Kardashev wasn't a brilliant wordsmith, his delivery awkward and his tone clear, but it worked its intended effect upon Yuri.\n\n"Yes, of course!" said Yuri suddenly, clear excitement on his face.

I have been informed that you and others loyal to you are sympathetic to the plight of people like me, and thus, I am humbly thanking you for your work and hope you continue to do so in the future. Thank you, Mr Kardashev. You can count on my support, in whatever capacity I and others like me can offer it.\n\nSincerely, A New Friend."\n\nA subtle smile crossed the physicist's face as he finished reading the anonymous letter. Happy and a good bit prideful, he stood back up straight and went to make sure the letter was disposed of, for the sake of his New Friend."

 kurchatov.17.d:0 ""I am glad to be able to speak with you in private, Comrade Keldysh," said Chelomei as he sat down with the People's Commissar of Science. Such a powerful ally would be invaluable in Chelomei's bid for Kurchatov's position.\n\n"We both know why you're here. What can you offer me that other candidates won't? WHy should the People's Commissariat of Science support you?"\n\n"I'm glad you asked. The People's Commissariat of Science is an invaluable asset of the Federation. However, we're squandering that asset's potential by spreading it too thin. We need to focus your efforts, ensure that your efforts do not go to waste. I think the People's Commissariat should focus on projects that strengthen our army, and strengthen the revolution."\n\n"Do elaborate, comrade. I'm interested in hearing what projects this would entail."\n\n"I'm talking about things like rockets. Alternative forms of weaponry. Even mind control. If the revolution is to succeed, then we need to obtain every advantage possible. There will of course be funding for more mundane science, but that type of thing doesn't really fit the Ultravisionary spirit, now does it?"\n\n"You've certainly intrigued me comrade, I must admit. Could I ask you to repeat some of that again? I want to have written proof so that I don't forget anything later.""
 kurchatov.17.a:0 ""I want to bring the Revolution brought to Mars by 1980, and we'll need your brilliance to get there.""

 kurchatov.18.d:0 "Chelomei looked over the unopened letter in his hands. He had made some bold promises to Mstislav Keldysh, and he hoped that Keldysh would see the opportunities that Chelomei could provide. He took out his letter opener, and extracted the paper. Clearly the People's Commissar of Science had written the document in a hurry, and Chelomei had to squint to decipher the man's handwriting.\n\n"Comrade Chelomei,\n\nI have thought about our last conversation for some time. The position of Vice Premier is an important one, and I wish only for the best candidate to lead the Federation.\n\nThat is why I have decided to support you for Vice Premier, and you can depend upon my vote when the time comes on the Presidium. I hope you uphold your promises. I understand you expect great things from us, but we also expect great things of you."\n\nChelomei leaned back in his chair, a smile stretching across his face. This was good news. Chelomei was getting ever closer to that coveted Vice Premiership. With the People's Commissariats for Foreign Affairs and Science on his side, the core pillars of Ultravisionary Socialism were on Chelomei's side."

The position of Vice Premier is an important one, and I wish only for the best candidate to lead the Federation.\n\nHowever, science must always strive to be impartial. The People's Commissariat of Science is an important pillar of the Federation, and we must not let our revolution fall into factionalism. As such, I can not in good faith commit to any candidates at this time..."\n\nChelomei crumpled up the letter and threw it in the garbage bin by his feet. Impartiality! Factionalism! What nonsense! At least they were remaining neutral on the matter. CHelomei could salvage this, there were still potential allies that he could sway to his side."

Keldysh hadn't seemed particularly enthusiastic when he left Kardashev's office, but Kardashev had thought that their conversation had been very productive. Today, however, his secretary stopped him as he was entering his office, carrying a folded piece of paper. It was from Keldysh.\n\n"Comrade Kardashev,\n\nI have thought about our last conversation for some time. The position of Vice Premier is an important one, and I wish only for the best candidate to lead the Federation.\n\nHowever, science must always strive to be impartial.

We merely wish the best for the Federation, and we only wish the best for science."\n\nKardashev put the paper down on his desk. That wasn't good.

 kurchatov.23.t:0 "The Long Search"
 kurchatov.23.d:0 "Vladmir Chelomei was not used to asking for directions or instructions from people; nor was he used to receiving anything that wasn't a straight answer. Thus when he started asking people for the location of the basement of the People's Commissariat of Aquatic Transport, he was not expecting evasiveness.\n\nHe certainly wasn't expecting the first response to be "What basement?" as the receptionist eyed him with confusion. "The basement. Do not take me for a fool; I wish to speak with the Director of Special Circumstances." "Who is... in our basement." She replied, giving him a look of utter derision. "Which doesn't exist. I have been here for years, and we've never-" Onto the next person, while she stared at him dumbfoundedly.\n\n"I am here looking for Special Circumstance's headquarters- where is the basement?"\n\n"What basement?" Vladimir blinked. "The basement. Special Circumstances headquarters..." "Comrade, in my many years of working here, we have never had a basement."\n\nThey can't be serious, can they? This has to be some form of joke, or some private mockery. Is Semichastny working with Kardashev, or was the location Chelomei was given wrong? No, no, it can't be wrong- Chelomei himself personally traced the rumors. Clearly, these people are either mocking him or simply idiots. Thus, he continued his long search. "I am looking for the basement." He stated- as he swung open a door dramatically. Closet. Bathroom. Storage room. "What basement?" Break room. Office. "The basement, comrade. I know you have one. Stop trying to hide it from me." Could it be a trapdoor? Behind a bookshelf? It has to be somewhere. If Vladmir Chelomei-\n\nA pause, as a hand taps on his shoulder, before resting on it. "Follow me, comrade." A voice spoke, as a black clothed, plain looking individual walked towards the closet he had swung open, entering- and opening a door behind a grouping of uniforms and shoeboxes, turning to him."
 kurchatov.23.a:0 ""In.""

 kurchatov.231.t:0 "The Basement"
 kurchatov.231.d:0 "The headquarters of the Directorate for the Investigation of Special Circumstances was large. It was far less of a basement and more of a sublevel of the building; with plenty of spacious offices, monitoring stations, and staff flooding through it. Agents in matte black uniforms with swordlike emblems strutted to and fro without a care, and Vladmir Chelomei did his best to hold his tongue- despite spending thirty five minutes hunting for such a large location. "Where is Semichastny's office? I need to speak to him about urgent-"\n\n"Follow." The agent leading him spoke, moving to a large room covered in chairs, firmly pausing once he was inside. "Wait."\n\nFor a moment, Chelomei considered his options- before sitting down in a chair and waiting. There was no television. There were no books. There were no other individuals waiting, and aside from the cold comfort of the quiet agent, Vladimir Chelomei was alone. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity the door opened, and he was led in utter silence to a desk. Plain, aside from the same swordlike emblem on the front of it that the agents seemed to have, and only having one occupant- Vladimir Semichastny, who was looking at papers.\n\n"I-" "Am here to ask for my support." Semichastny interrupted, not even bothering to look up. "You have it." Chelomi blinked, as the agent motioned to the door, and Semichastny did not give him so much as a passing glance. The only acknowledgement he got was a single reflexive look up as the door shut between the two- as the agent led Chelomei up and out."

 kurchatov.24.t:0 "Long Hours"
 kurchatov.24.d:0 "Nikolai Kardashev had no clue where the Directorate for the Investigation of Special Circumstances was; and apparently neither did anyone else. No matter who he asked, there didn't seem to be an answer. Rather- a straight answer. "I'm pretty sure it's in...one of those buildings." An aide pointed to a map, as Nikolai blinked, before nodding as he made his way through and around them. The Directorate of Agriculture? No. "Perhaps if you'd try the People's Commissariat of Aquatic Transport..." No. "I don't know who told you to look here, but perhaps..."\n\nDown more streets he walked, and got more and more dismissals, or directions that led nowhere- before a single flicker of hope. A single, matte black clad woman in a leather coat stood at a street corner with a cigarette in her mouth, a small accessory to their apathetic stare as they observed his approach. "Excuse me, Ma'm. I am looking for the Directorate for the Investigation of Special Circumstances. I would like to meet with Vladimir Semichastny to discuss-"\n\n"Special Circumstances?" The woman interrupted, taking the cigarette out of her mouth as Kardashev blinked. "Special Circumstances for what? What kind of Special Circumstances are we in, comrade?" She asked, tone inquisitive- even as her facial expression refused to change."

 kurchatov.241.t:0 "The Letter"
 kurchatov.241.d:0 "The first thing on Nikolai Kardashev's mind when he found the note on his desk was that he recalled locking the door. In fact, he specifically remembered locking it before leaving- and yet, nothing was missing. Nothing had been overturned, or removed, or destroyed. All that was different was a single note on his desk with a badge- complete with a hexagonal sword-and-orbit emblem that he knew as connected to Special Circumstances, and he had recalled locking the door. That wasn't in here before he had left; had they broken in, deposited the note, and broken out? More importantly- the note.\n\n"To People's Commissar Nikolai Kardashev."\n\n"You have my support- and your persistence is an admirable quality. We will likely see each other in the future. Vladimir Semichastny."\n\nAny of the individuals outside of the office likely noted a small outburst of excitement, followed by a large sigh of relief."

 kurchatov.25.d:0 "When the most pro-military of two candidates goes to a meeting of generals, he expects applause. Accolades. Cheers. All of these things are exactly what Vladmir Chelomei gets in spades- from Varennikov, while Oplesnin simply smiles politely. "Gentlemen. You are several of the greatest military minds of our time- and beyond that. You already know what I am here to ask for. Need I continue?"\n\nWith that, Chelomei falls silent with a smirk- and waits patiently. A passive observer to the rest of the meeting would have called the decision inevitable- which to an extent in Vladmir's eyes, it was. "You have our support, of course. Only you can lead us into the future." Varennikov spoke, beaming as the others applauded. It was all easy- too easy. Yet, there was no opposition. No one raised their voice, or debated against him in the slightest, or did anything to question or deviate. It was almost eerie how in sync the entire thing was; but Chelomei put these thoughts aside. Of course they'd pick him. After all, he was their superior- and the clear choice."
 kurchatov.25.a:0 "No surprises here."

 kurchatov.26.t:0 "A Meeting of Somewhat Like Minds"
 kurchatov.26.d:0 "The moment Kardashev sat down across from Nikolai Oplesnin, he knew, from the hard look in the general's eyes, that he had his work cut out for him.\n\nHe needed to demonstrate support from the military in order to advance his claim on the Vice Premiership, and while he had been told Oplesnin was naturally sympathetic to his viewpoints on political and economic matters, the general was not going to give him his endorsement for free. That would come with a cost.\n\nAnd, so, Kardashev spoke at length about his plans for the military, should he be so endorsed. He spoke of a more efficient intelligence apparatus. About increasing the military's efficiency in all matters. About the absolute necessity for encouraging an apolitical nature within the armed forces, and thereby ensure state stability.\n\nOplesnin listened patiently, and Kardashev could tell that he, in general, quite liked what he heard. But, and most critically for any statement of support, he had not yet been told how much effort and political capital Kardashev was willing to spend to achieve the transformations promised.\n\nAnd that decision would make all the difference."
 kurchatov.26.a:0 "Promise him some effort."

 kurchatov.27.d:0 "Kardashev had not realized he had been holding his breath until the moment Oplesnin offered, in response to his entreaty, a slight nod. It was as if a weight had been removed from his chest.\n\nAs Oplesnin began to speak, some of that weight returned. But not nearly as much as he had feared, when first sitting down. The general was very clear that he supported Kardashev's goals for the military establishment, and that he was convinced that the promise would, at the very least, be fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.\n\nHe would not, however, openly support Kardashev's candidacy. As had been said, an apolitical military was a laudable and critical goal, and could not but be exemplified in the present. What he would do, however, was remain abjectly neutral in a personal sense. He would also work to ensure the rest of the General Staff behaved similarly.\n\nStanding and shaking hands, Kardashev turned to leave. It was not all he had wanted, but as the general had said, exemplifying - and thus proving - the belief of apoliticity was important. In addition and at the very least, though he was not receiving an endorsement from the military establishment, neither was Chelomei.\n\nAnd, Kardashev decided, that was good enough."
 kurchatov.27.a:0 "The best outcome reasonably possible."

 kurchatov.28.t:0 "Somewhat Like Minds Diverge"

It was as if the sudden weight that he felt on his chest had been increased tremendously.\n\nAs Oplesnin began to speak, it only continued to do so. The general was very clear that he was not convinced of Kardashev's drive to implement the promises made, and that, while he supported the ideas in general, he would not extend that support towards the candidacy for the Vice Premiership.\n\nAt least, and to Kardashev's extreme consternation, not to his own candidacy. Oplesnin made it clear that he, and the military in general, could not but support his rival. Chelomei was, after all, the People's Commissar for Defense as well as the military's superior, and all boons they had so far received had come through him. As well as an intelligent and committed man besides. To scorn that largesse would be a slight not forgotten, by anyone.\n\nStanding and shaking hands in a most perfunctory manner, Kardashev turned to leave. He had to fight to conceal his disappointment. It might have been naive of him to expect any other outcome, but he had all the same.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, his loss was Chelomei's gain."

"Gentleman of the board, it is an honor to speak to you. As you know I have been looking into becoming the vice premier of the federation, and it would be in your best interest to endorse my candidacy in the Presidium."\n\n"I believe the federation has not gone far enough to expand ultravisionary superculture into the stars, even going into defunding research into the fields of space exploration and conquest. I know as well that the acquirement of resources has been an issue, with less than enough to come close to the development of rocket technology. With the tide coming closer to an ultravisionary socialist united Russia, I assure you that your needs will be met! Russia will enter into the stars and soviet weaponry and technology will spread throughout the galaxy. Kardashev will only ignore the greatness we can achieve with the militarization of space, but I promise that I will not ignore this tenet of ultravisionism, and this board will get what it needs to conquer the stars!"\n\nWith the conclusion of his speech, Chelomei expected a standing ovation. All he got was a cough. A balding man stood up out of his seat, obviously the chairman. "Comrade Chelomei, we are thankful for your support, but we need more... specific promises. We have long dealt with vague assurances of funding year after year, yet we receive nothing when the time comes. What will you ensure the Board will receive?"\n\n"Chelomei paused, knowing he needed the support of the board, but what to promise them? Promising them too much would be costly for the future, but not enough would surely offer him little support. He stood quietly for a moment, then blurted-""

"Comrade Chelomei, you have your endorsement!"\n\nChelomei smiled and stepped off the podium as the board began to formally vote to endorse him, looking as if it was unanimous. He had done it, and the Board for Intersolar Activities was a very important ally as well. He just hoped he hadn't promised too much, but he wouldn't have to worry about that yet.\n\nGrabbing a glass of water, one of the board members patted him on the back, saying, "I just wanted to thank you personally, Comrade Chelomei. It seems you higher-ups have finally shown they truly care about socialist space exploration. I do hope you uphold your promise if you are elected."\n\nChelomei glanced down, then back at the board member.

We were selected to be a part of this board to not worry about political matters, and it is better off if we do not intervene in the Presidium's decision. We hope you understand."\n\nChelomei sighed, all that effort for nothing. "Thank you for inviting me anyway, gentlemen, comrades.

As you know, my goal to become the next Vice Premier is still ongoing, and I need as much support in the Presidium as I can get, which you can provide. Now, my proposals for a better space program are much different than some others of the Presidium. I know many who have promised the militarization of space and millions of other things, many unachievable. Instead of a militarized space program, I propose a more peaceful one."\n\n"One where we explore the stars, not out to conquer in the name of socialism, but to learn, and to improve our own self. To be honest, it will be a challenge, but one we can overcome and not impossible."\n\nKardeshev paused, seeing what the responses from the board were and continued, "I also propose a peaceful answer to ensure we gain resources from our stars, space industrialization. Instead of militarizing space, we must use it to our advantage! Unending resources in our hands only, our supremacy of technology bringing us forward! Without competition from the imperialists, we will rise!"\n\nEnding his speech, Kardeshev anticipated the board's reaction. The chairman was beginning to look interested. "I like where your ideas are coming from, comrade Kardeshev, but the industrialization of space sounds like a difficult task. What can you promise to make it worth all the effort that must be put into it?""

"Your speech has been very persuasive, I believe you have your endorsement."\n\n"Thank you, and I promise I will do all I can as your Vice Premier." On that note, Kurchatov stepped off the podium as the board began their official vote to extend their endorsement to him, looking as if it were unanimous. Grabbing a glass of water, Kardashev reflected to himself. Would he be able to get the board what they wanted? The Federation already short on funds after years of war and development, and it would only get worse. But then again, Zhdanov had always been confident during the speeches he had given. As his Vice Premier, he would make sure the federation achieved what every person in Russia dreamed of, no matter the cost.\n\nA true socialist civilization was coming, and it wouldn't stop until it hit the very edges of the galaxy."

We have also collectively decided we cannot endorse any candidate, as we do not want to involve ourselves in political matters.\n\nKardashev's eyes lowered to the ground. "I understand your decision, but I do hope you know that I will uphold my promise if I do become Vice Premier. I want nothing more than to see our federation exploring the stars, but I know you are the ones who will do it.

The door swung open and in came Chelomei, with his own neat stack of papers clasped against his chest.\n\n"Comrade Sheremetyev, good to see you." Began Chelomei. Sheremetyev simply nodded in response before looking up.\n\n"Good to see you aswell. I don't have a lot of time so lets get down to business. What is it you wanted to talk to me about today?"\n\n"I've noticed that there has been more and more strain on your Commissariat as our territory grows and people expect more amenities. I have a solution that would make both our jobs easier, but I can't put it into practice until I'm chosen as Vice Premier. Can I count on your support?"\n\nCautious but intrigued, Sheremetyev replied, "Well, what is it?

Sheremetyev peered onto the first page, reading the title of the dossier: "Visionary Social Commitments."\n\n"Exactly what it says in bold.

He had been expecting a call from Sheremetyev, but he had assumed that, with Sheremetyev's busy schedule, he would not be calling until this evening. But, nonetheless, there was Alexander's voice on the other end.\n\n"Good afternoon, Comrade. I've just finished reading your proposal. Quite creative I must say..."\n\n"Well that's good news. What did you think of it, then?"\n\n"At first I was skeptical, I admit - I'm so used to working with machines, I'm not too well versed in sociology or anything like that. But, the numbers seem right and the concept is well thought out. If this were put into action, well, I'd have to mock up a proper projection to get a real number, but efficiency would almost certainly improve."\n\n"So, I can count on your support, then?"\n\n"Of course, comrade. You proved yourself both honest and efficient. Have a wonderful day." Finished Sheremetyev before hanging up. Chelomei placed his own telephone down and turned back to his desk. Smiling to himself, he leaned back in his seat and slipped back into a daydream."

What's your game?"\n\nStartled and confused, Chelomei sputtered a reply, "Wh-what do you mean, Comrade?"\n\n"Your proposal is bullshit. I read it and felt a little suspicious of your numbers so I had some of my own analysts go over it and you know what they said? 'His proposal is bullshit'."\n\nAfter taking a deep breath, and silently cursing himself, Chemolei sighed. "I suppose this means I can't count on your support in my pursuit of Vice Premier, then?"\n\n"Sounds about right, comrade. Next time you're looking for support, either be more honest or find someone as dishonest as yourself." Sheremetyev hung up, and Chemolei sat at his desk staring out his window in shock.\n\n"Bastard."

According to his watch, he had arrived five minutes before he was meant to, having called ahead to tell the Commissar that he would be coming by at 4:00. Shrugging, although a little worried that his lack of punctuality would cause him to catch the Commissar off guard, he knocked on the door.\n\nSheremetyev's voice could be heard through the wood, beckoning Kardashev to come in. Entering the office, Kardashev saw the Commissar sitting amid a mound of paperwork stacked on his desk. The two men greeted eachother, friendly but curt, before Kardashev got right down to business.\n\n"I know you must be busy, but I've had some ideas I think you might want to look into."\n\n"Ideas, you say?" Replied Sheremetyev.\n\n"Yes. I've been doing some research, and some thinking, and I think I have an idea of how we could vastly increase productivity here in the industry sector... provided I make Vice Premier."\n\n"Really, now?" Sheremetyev, cautious but interested. "Could you explain some of it to me?"\n\n"Sure! And here, I've written some projections down as well." Kardashev added, placing down yet another stack of papers. Kardashev then sat down, going through his plans, ideas and promises while the Commissar frantically took notes. When all was said and done, Kardashev stood up. "Thank you for meeting with me today. I hope I can count on your support for my efforts towards becoming Vice Premier."\n\n"I'll have to look over your work, but... I'm sure it will check out.""

Kardashev nodded, before realizing the gesture was pointless on a phone call.\n\n"I looked over your notes, and the ones I took during our conversation, with a few of my analysts. I admit, at first I was skeptical with how far reaching and optimistic your ideas were, but they seem both achievable and efficient. With you in the position of Vice Premier, I'm positive we could make a change for the better in this country's industry."\n\n"That's great news! Thank you, Comrade."\n\n"Of course, of course. Honesty is something that I appreciate, and you proved to me that you can reach for the stars and goddamn deliver. I look forward to your reign as Vice Premier, if you make it there. Good night.""

Your ideas seemed ludicrous, but I thought 'Nikolai's a smart guy, he can pull through with stuff like this'. Turns out they really were, though."\n\n"Wh-what do you mean? I checked everything." Kardashev was shocked, and was already reddenning in embarrassment.\n\n"Apparently not enough. The numbers are all wrong, made-up technologies are implemented - and things like safety precautions and costs are completely left out at some points. It's just all too much of a reach, Nikolai. You're always looking so far ahead without even thinking about how your plans might end up. I want a Vice Premier who is capable of honesty about the feasibility of his goals. Your papers tell of a man who doesn't quite know how to get where he's going. I'm sorry." Kardashev's phone clicked as Sheremetyev hung up his own.

"You may be wondering what I'm doing here, at a place known for only records-keeping and census-taking. I'm sure you have heard already I am looking forwards to becoming the next Vice Premier, and it is now my responsibility to gain support from all around the government, you included. Which is why I decided to come up with a new innovation that will change your jobs forever. I call it Visionary Management Techniques, and it will rebuild this entire bureau! New methods of administration and bureaucracy, all to make your jobs easier!"\n\n"With what though?" A tweedy man in the back interrupted. "We've done everything we can to make things easier, that's part of our job. There's nothing left to improve pen and paper."\n\nAh, but that's the thing," said Chelomei. "We will do away with the nonvisionary pen and paper, via computerization! Machines will lead bureaucracy into a new age of wonder, and I assure you your jobs will be made twice as easier!"\n\nThe manager approached the front of the room, saying, "This all sounds amazing, Comrade Chelomei, but what is the timeframe we are looking at to have our Commissariat modernized?""

Opening it up, it was exactly what he had hoped for, from the rather reclusive Alexey Poskonov no less.\n\nThe People's Commissar had written a short letter, and reading it to himself, Chelomei knew he had promised the right things. \nComrade Chelomei - it began - I am impressed with what I have heard from some of the others in my bureau, and I'm even disappointed I could not hear it myself.

Care to give me a few moments of your time?"\n\n"Well, we were in the middle of an important meeting-"\n\n"Perfect, it will only be a few minutes!" Interrupted Kardashev as he motioned for the manager to sit down. "Now, how would you feel if I told you that everyone in this room would have their jobs revolutionized if I were to win the vote in the Presidium. I have discovered a new way to transform government administration, called cybernetic management. Cybernetic management is the way of the future, and it is closer than you may think. Without much in complex technology or the dependence on computers, an important bureau such as yours could be twice as productive. With cybernetic management, a full reorganization of the management and work process could create peak administrative efficiency. I also propose more automation in the workplace, giving computers more menial tasks and making sure everyone knows their job. With computers taking the less desirable work, the worker can be managed like a well-oiled machine.""

"Commissar Kardashev, you have a letter from Commisar Poskonov." Taking the letter inquisitively, he was surprised it was from the rather reclusive Poskonov.\n\nHe had written a short letter, and reading it to himself, Kardashev smiled.

Kardashev had expended all of his other options, leaving only one decision left.\n\nKardashev sighed. He didn't want to do this, but his hands were tied.

Every other option had been expanded, and Chelomei had been forced into an unenviable position.

Within any amount of time, Nikolai Kardashev could be pronounced the new Paramount Leader, and immediately deal with the problems that the United Soviet Federation has.\n\nHow is he going to be able to make it more sustainable? How will they deal with the deficit? Is he capable of taking the burdens of an entire country on his shoulders? Thankfully, he is interrupted- jarringly snapping out of his daydreams as the phone rings; quickly flooding his ear with sound as he lifts it up.

Everything. Even with all the advances they were looking into, all things died. And that included the Paramount Leader himself. Nothing could change that, and nothing would change the fact that Andrei Zhdanov would one day be in a casket, with Chelomei at his funeral. Perhaps he'd say kind words, or sorrowful ones.

 kardashev.2.d:0 "When Vice-Premier Nikolai Kardashev had heard, in the night, his bodyguards knock on his door, he had known from the urgency by which they did so that something important had happened.\n\nAnd it had. Andrei Zhdanov was dead.\n\nThings had moved very quickly after that indeed, in order to secure proper and ordered succession. Nobody wanted a repeat of the end stages of the old Republic, after all, and late that morning he found himself standing in front of the assembled Presidium.\n\nHe had put some words together, to provide to the delegates following his official elevation to the office of Paramount Leader. He spoke of unity within the Federation. About the greatness of the man who had led them to this point. And about how all men had to trust their vision to somebody else to be carried forward. He pledged to do so.\n\nThe applause was, of course, unanimous. It was also, Kardashev could tell, perfunctory. He would have to work hard to secure support from many who did not trust him, and who clearly thought, judging by the glances thrown towards the man, that Chelomei should have been standing in his spot.\n\nBut as Paramount Leader Kardashev stepped down from the platform, he knew that he could. He had always been a hard worker, and this was just one more challenge to overcome."

 kardashev.3.t:0 "An Unclear Vision"
 kardashev.3.d:0 "Nikolai Kardashev sat in the chair he had spent years standing in front of. The Paramount Leader's chair. Zhdanov's chair. His chair.\n\nHe was still, in truth, processing the change. Ever since his elevation to Vice-Premier he had of course known it was coming, especially with Zhdanov's declining health, but knowing and experiencing were, as many had told him, very different things. So far, he had coped with the shift through focusing on other things.\n\nThings such as the workmen carefully and respectfully packaging Zhdanov's personal effects, for distribution to family or state museums as indicated by his will and final wishes. It would not be long before he had to move his own effects in to replace them. There was much more space to fill. Physically and metaphorically.\n\nTurning his mind to the future, Kardashev swiveled the chair and looked out the enormous windows. He was the Federation's steward now, and he knew there would have to be change. Many of the Federation's programs were simply unsustainable, and though he had no idea how to begin unravelling the dense network of unnecessary commissions and project boards that were so prevalent, he was keenly aware of the need to figure it out. Quickly.\n\nIt was time to, as best as he was able, get to work."

 chelomei.1.t:0 "An Ultravisionary Visit"
 chelomei.1.d:0 "Leaving the hospital, Vladimir Chelomei struggled to reconcile determination with shock. He knew now that Andrei Zhdanov was not long for this world.\n\nSummoned in the dark of night and driven by Zhdanov's bodyguards to the hospital, he had fought to keep himself composed when he saw the man. Zhdanov was a figure who had always been larger than life, dominating every room he was in, and now he looked sick. Weak. Old, for the first time ever.\n\nWorse, he could barely speak. Could barely leverage the talent that, along with a visionary mind had been, more than anything else, responsible for the Federation even existing in the first place. But he had struggled through, and though his words were halting, Zhdanov spoke to Chelomei. Told him that he knew he was going to die. Told him that he had to keep the vision moving forward.\n\nChelomei had been quick to pledge to do so. To pledge to see his leader's vision through to its conclusion. It was what he knew Zhdanov wanted to hear, of course, but it was also his firm belief. He had been an orthodox Ultravisionary for many years, and he had no intention of deviating now, in the moments of greatest peril for the agenda as a whole.\n\nAnd though uncertain for the future, shaken and struggling as he still was, Chelomei knew he would fight to ensure that the promise he had made was properly kept."

As a man clearly believed to share Zhdanov's ideals and desires, he knew that the delegates were confident in his ability to continue the path shown to him by their departed icon. A small faction was clearly unhappy, but they mattered little, and would soon have no influence at all.\n\nAs Paramount Leader Chelomei stepped down from the platform, he kept his outside expression solemn. But, inside, he was smiling, knowing that his mentor had passed on with the surety that his vision would be continued."
